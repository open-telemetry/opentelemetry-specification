## Usage

### How to Create a Log4J Log Appender

A [log appender](../glossary.md#log-appender--bridge) implementation can be used
to bridge logs into the [Log SDK](./sdk.md)
OpenTelemetry [LogRecordExporters](sdk.md#logrecordexporter). This approach is
typically used for applications which are fine with changing the log transport
and is [one of the supported](README.md#direct-to-collector) log collection
approaches.

The log appender implementation will typically acquire a
[Logger](./api.md#logger), then
call [Emit LogRecord](./api.md#emit-a-logrecord) for `LogRecord`s
received from the application.

[Implicit Context Injection](#implicit-context-injection)
and [Explicit Context Injection](#explicit-context-injection) describe how an
Appender injects `TraceContext` into `LogRecord`s.

![Appender](img/appender.png)

This same approach can be also used for example for:

- Python logging library by creating a Handler.
- Go zap logging library by implementing the Core interface. Note that since
  there is no implicit Context in Go it is not possible to get and use the
  active Span.

Log appenders can be created in OpenTelemetry language libraries by OpenTelemetry
maintainers, or by 3rd parties for any logging library that supports a similar
extension mechanism. This specification recommends each OpenTelemetry language
library to include out-of-the-box Appender implementation for at least one
popular logging library.

### Logger Name

If the logging library has a concept that is similar to OpenTelemetry's
definition of the [Instrumentation Scope's](../glossary.md#instrumentation-scope)
name, then the appender's implementation should use that value as the
name parameter when [obtaining the Logger](./api.md#get-a-logger).

This is for example applicable to:

- Logger name in [Log4J](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-api/latest/org.apache.logging.log4j/org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.html)
- Channel name in [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/3.4.0/doc/01-usage.md#leveraging-channels)

Appenders should avoid setting any attributes of the Instrumentation Scope.
Doing so may result in different appenders setting different attributes on the
same Instrumentation Scope, obtained with the same identity of the
[Logger](./api.md#get-a-logger), which, according to the specification,
is an error.

### Context

#### Implicit Context Injection

When Context is implicitly available (e.g. in Java) the Appender can rely on
automatic context propagation by NOT explicitly setting `Context` when
calling [emit a LogRecord](./api.md#emit-a-logrecord).

Some log libraries have mechanisms specifically tailored for injecting
contextual information into logs, such as MDC in Log4j. When available, it may
be preferable to use these mechanisms to set the Context. A log appender can
then fetch the Context and explicitly set it when
calling [emit a LogRecord](./api.md#emit-a-logrecord). This allows the correct Context
to be included even when log records are emitted asynchronously, which can
otherwise lead the Context to be incorrect.

TODO: clarify how works or doesn't work when the log statement call site and the
log appender are executed on different threads.

#### Explicit Context Injection

In order for `TraceContext` to be recorded in `LogRecord`s in languages where
the Context must be provided explicitly (e.g. Go), the end user must capture the
Context and explicitly pass it to the logging subsystem. The log appender must
take this Context and explicitly set it when
calling [emit a LogRecord](./api.md#emit-a-logrecord).

Support for OpenTelemetry for logging libraries in these languages typically can
be implemented in the form of logger wrappers that can capture the context once,
when the span is created and then use the wrapped logger to execute log
statements in a normal way. The wrapper will be responsible for injecting the
captured context in the logs.

This specification does not define how exactly it is achieved since the actual
mechanism depends on the language and the particular logging library used. In
any case the wrappers are expected to make use of the Trace Context API to get
the current active span.

See
[an example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/aeb198d6de25588afef49545cfa06533d0e67f1d/bridges/otelzap/core.go#L194-L244)
of how it can be done for zap logging library for Go.

### Advanced Processing

There are many ways and places of implementing log processing, including:

1. The OpenTelemetry Collector
2. The [OpenTelemetry Logs SDK](sdk.md)
3. A bridged logging library
4. A backend observability system

Each approach has different benefits and drawbacks.
This section focuses on how the OpenTelemetry Logs SDK can be used
to perform advanced compound processing using multiple processors.

Below are examples of how to build custom log processing using the
[Logs SDK](sdk.md). These examples use the [Go Logs SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log)
for illustration purposes. Consult the language-specific documentation
to determine feasibility in other languages.

#### Altering

Log records can be modified by mutating the log record passed to the processor.
Below is an example of a processor that redacts tokens from log record
attributes.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"strings"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log"
	sdklog "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
)

// RedactTokensProcessor redacts values from attributes
// that contain "token" in the key.
type RedactTokensProcessor struct{}

// OnEmit redacts values from attributes containing "token" in the key
// by replacing them with "REDACTED".
func (p *RedactTokensProcessor) OnEmit(ctx context.Context, record *sdklog.Record) error {
	record.WalkAttributes(func(kv log.KeyValue) bool {
		if strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(kv.Key), "token") {
			record.AddAttributes(log.String(kv.Key, "REDACTED"))
		}
		return true
	})
	return nil
}
```

#### Filtering

Filtering can be achieved by [decorating](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)
a processor. For example, here's how filtering based on Severity can be achieved.

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log"
	sdklog "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
)

// SeverityProcessor filters out log records with severity below the given threshold.
type SeverityProcessor struct {
	sdklog.Processor
	Min log.Severity
}

// OnEmit passes ctx and record to the wrapped sdklog.Processor
// if the record's severity is greater than or equal to p.Min.
// Otherwise, the record is dropped (the wrapped processor is not invoked).
func (p *SeverityProcessor) OnEmit(ctx context.Context, record *sdklog.Record) error {
	if record.Severity() != log.SeverityUndefined && record.Severity() < p.Min {
		return nil
	}
	return p.Processor.OnEmit(ctx, record)
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> As mentioned earlier, these examples are for illustration purposes.
> Go developers can take advantage of the
> [`go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/processors/minsev`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/processors/minsev)
> module.

#### Isolating

Isolating a processing pipeline can be supported by
[composing](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite) processors.
The example below demonstrates an isolated processor that ensures each processor
operates on a copy of the log record:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"errors"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
)

// IsolatedProcessor composes multiple processors so that they are isolated.
type IsolatedProcessor struct {
	Processors []log.Processor
}

// OnEmit passes ctx and a clone of record to the each wrapped sdklog.Processor.
func (p *IsolatedProcessor) OnEmit(ctx context.Context, record *log.Record) error {
	var rErr error
	r := record.Clone()
	for _, proc := range p.Processors {
		if err := proc.OnEmit(ctx, &r); err != nil {
			rErr = errors.Join(rErr, err)
		}
	}
	return rErr
}
```

#### Routing

Additional capabilities, such as routing or fan-out, can be implemented by
combining processors in different ways. The following example demonstrates
a processor that routes event records separately from log records:

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
)

// LogEventRouteProcessor routes log records and event records separately.
type LogEventRouteProcessor struct {
	LogProcessor log.Processor
	EventProcessor log.Processor
}

// OnEmit calls EventProcessor if the record has a non-empty event name.
// Otherwise, it calls LogProcessor.
func (p *LogEventRouteProcessor) OnEmit(ctx context.Context, record *log.Record) error {
	if record.EventName() != "" {
		return p.EventProcessor.OnEmit(ctx, record)
	}
	return p.LogProcessor.OnEmit(ctx, record)
}
```

#### Setup

The following example sets up log processing using all of the processors
described above.

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlplog/otlploghttp"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdoutlog"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log"
	sdklog "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
)


// NewLoggerProvider creates a new logger provider.
// - Event records with severity not lower than Info are exported via OTLP.
// - Event records have token attributes redacted.
// - Non-event log records with severity not lower than Debug are synchronously emitted to stdout.
func NewLoggerProvider() (*sdklog.LoggerProvider, error) {
	// Events processing setup.
	otlpExp, err := otlploghttp.New(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	evtProc := &SeverityProcessor{
		// This processing is isolated so that there is no chance
		// that log records send to stdout have their token attributes redacted.
		Processor: &IsolatedProcessor{
			Processors: []sdklog.Processor{
				&RedactTokensProcessor{},
				sdklog.NewBatchProcessor(otlpExp),
			},
		},
		Min: log.SeverityInfo,
	}

	// Logs processing setup.
	stdoutExp, err := stdoutlog.New()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	logProc := &SeverityProcessor{
		Processor: sdklog.NewSimpleProcessor(stdoutExp),
		Min:       log.SeverityDebug,
	}

	// Create logs provider with log/event routing.
	provider := sdklog.NewLoggerProvider(
		sdklog.WithProcessor(&LogEventRouteProcessor{
			LogProcessor:   logProc,
			EventProcessor: evtProc,
		}),
	)
	return provider, nil
}
```
