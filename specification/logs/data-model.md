This is a data model and semantic conventions that allow to represent logs from
various sources: application log files, machine generated events, system logs,
etc. Existing log formats can be unambiguously mapped to this data model.
Reverse mapping from this data model is also possible to the extent that the
target log format has equivalent capabilities.

The purpose of the data model is to have a common understanding of what a log
record is, what data needs to be recorded, transferred, stored and interpreted
by a logging system.

This proposal defines a data model for
[Standalone Logs](../glossary.md#standalone-log).

## Design Notes

### Requirements

The Data Model was designed to satisfy the following requirements:

- It should be possible to unambiguously map existing log formats to this Data
  Model. Translating log data from an arbitrary log format to this Data Model
  and back should ideally result in identical data.

- Mappings of other log formats to this Data Model should be semantically
  meaningful. The Data Model must preserve the semantics of particular elements
  of existing log formats.

- Translating log data from an arbitrary log format A to this Data Model and
  then translating from the Data Model to another log format B ideally must
  result in a meaningful translation of log data that is no worse than a
  reasonable direct translation from log format A to log format B.

- It should be possible to efficiently represent the Data Model in concrete
  implementations that require the data to be stored or transmitted. We
  primarily care about 2 aspects of efficiency: CPU usage for
  serialization/deserialization and space requirements in serialized form. This
  is an indirect requirement that is affected by the specific representation of
  the Data Model rather than the Data Model itself, but is still useful to keep
  in mind.

The Data Model aims to successfully represent 3 sorts of logs and events:

- System Formats. These are logs and events generated by the operating system
  and over which we have no control - we cannot change the format or affect what
  information is included (unless the data is generated by an application which
  we can modify). An example of system format is Syslog.

- Third-party Applications. These are generated by third-party applications. We
  may have certain control over what information is included, e.g. customize the
  format. An example is Apache log file.

- First-party Applications. These are applications that we develop and we have
  some control over how the logs and events are generated and what information
  we include in the logs. We can likely modify the source code of the
  application if needed.

### Field Kinds

This Data Model defines a logical model for a log record (irrespective of the
physical format and encoding of the record). Each record contains 2 kinds of
fields:

- Named top-level fields of specific type and meaning.

- Fields stored in the key/value pair lists, which can contain arbitrary values
  of different types. The keys and values for well-known fields follow semantic
  conventions for key names and possible values that allow all parties that work
  with the field to have the same interpretation of the data. See references to
  semantic conventions for `Resource` and `Attributes` fields and examples in
  [Appendix A](#appendix-a-example-mappings).

The reasons for having these 2 kinds of fields are:

- Ability to efficiently represent named top-level fields, which are almost
  always present (e.g. when using encodings like Protocol Buffers where fields
  are enumerated but not named on the wire).
  
- Ability to enforce types of named fields, which is very useful for compiled
  languages with type checks.

- Flexibility to represent less frequent data via key/value pair lists. This
  includes well-known data that has standardized semantics as well as arbitrary
  custom data that the application may want to include in the logs.

When designing this data model we followed the following reasoning to make a
decision about when to use a top-level named field:

- The field needs to be either mandatory for all records or be frequently
  present in well-known log and event formats (such as `Timestamp`) or is
  expected to be often present in log records in upcoming logging systems (such
  as `TraceId`).

- The fieldâ€™s semantics must be the same for all known log and event formats and
  can be mapped directly and unambiguously to this data model.
  
Both of the above conditions were required to give the field a place in the
top-level structure of the record.

## Log and Event Record Definition

Note: below we use type `any`, which can be a scalar value (number, string or
boolean), or an array or map of values. Arbitrary deep nesting of values for
arrays and maps is allowed (essentially allow to represent an equivalent of a
JSON object).

[Appendix A](#appendix-a-example-mappings) contains many examples that show how
existing log formats map to the fields defined below. If there are questions
about the meaning of the field reviewing the examples may be helpful.

Here is the list of fields in a log record:

Field Name     |Description
---------------|--------------------------------------------
Timestamp      |Time when the event occurred.
TraceId        |Request trace id.
SpanId         |Request span id.
TraceFlags     |W3C trace flag.
SeverityText   |The severity text (also known as log level).
SeverityNumber |Numerical value of the severity.
Name           |Short event identifier.
Body           |The body of the log record.
Resource       |Describes the source of the log.
Attributes     |Additional information about the event.

Below is the detailed description of each field.

### Field: `Timestamp`

Type: Timestamp, uint64 nanoseconds since Unix epoch.

Description: Time when the event occurred measured by the origin clock. This
field is optional, it may be missing if the timestamp is unknown.

### Trace Context Fields

#### Field: `TraceId`

Type: byte sequence.

Description: Request trace id as defined in
[W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-id). Can be set
for logs that are part of request processing and have an assigned trace id. This
field is optional.

#### Field: `SpanId`

Type: byte sequence.

Description: Span id. Can be set for logs that are part of a particular
processing span. If SpanId is present TraceId SHOULD be also present. This field
is optional.

#### Field: `TraceFlags`

Type: byte.

Description: Trace flag as defined in
[W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-flags)
specification. At the time of writing the specification defines one flag - the
SAMPLED flag. This field is optional.

### Severity Fields

#### Field: `SeverityText`

Type: string.

Description: severity text (also known as log level). This is the original
string representation of the severity as it is known at the source. If this
field is missing and `SeverityNumber` is present then the short name that
corresponds to the `SeverityNumber` may be used as a substitution. This field is
optional.

#### Field: `SeverityNumber`

Type: number.

Description: numerical value of the severity, normalized to values described in
this document. This field is optional.

`SeverityNumber` is an integer number. Smaller numerical values correspond to
less severe events (such as debug events), larger numerical values correspond to
more severe events (such as errors and critical events). The following table
defines the meaning of `SeverityNumber` value:

SeverityNumber range|Range name|Meaning
--------------------|----------|-------
1-4                 |TRACE     |A fine-grained debugging event. Typically disabled in default configurations.
5-8                 |DEBUG     |A debugging event.
9-12                |INFO      |An informational event. Indicates that an event happened.
13-16               |WARN      |A warning event. Not an error but is likely more important than an informational event.
17-20               |ERROR     |An error event. Something went wrong.
21-24               |FATAL     |A fatal error such as application or system crash.

Smaller numerical values in each range represent less important (less severe)
events. Larger numerical values in each range represent more important (more
severe) events. For example `SeverityNumber=17` describes an error that is less
critical than an error with `SeverityNumber=20`.

#### Mapping of `SeverityNumber`

Mappings from existing logging systems and formats (or **source format** for
short) must define how severity (or log level) of that particular format
corresponds to `SeverityNumber` of this data model based on the meaning given
for each range in the above table.

If the source format has more than one severity that matches a single range in
this table then the severities of the source format must be assigned numerical
values from that range according to how severe (important) the source severity
is.

For example if the source format defines "Error" and "Critical" as error events
and "Critical" is a more important and more severe situation then we can choose
the following `SeverityNumber` values for the mapping: "Error"->17,
"Critical"->18.

If the source format has only a single severity that matches the meaning of the
range then it is recommended to assign that severity the smallest value of the
range.

For example if the source format has an "Informational" log level and no other
log levels with similar meaning then it is recommended to use
`SeverityNumber=9` for "Informational".

Source formats that do not define a concept of severity or log level MAY omit
`SeverityNumber` and `SeverityText` fields. Backend and UI may represent log
records with missing severity information distinctly or may interpret log
records with missing `SeverityNumber` and `SeverityText` fields as if the
`SeverityNumber` was set equal to INFO (numeric value of 9).

#### Reverse Mapping

When performing a reverse mapping from `SeverityNumber` to a specific format
and the `SeverityNumber` has no corresponding mapping entry for that format
then it is recommended to choose the target severity that is in the same
severity range and is closest numerically.

For example Zap has only one severity in the INFO range, called "Info". When
doing reverse mapping all `SeverityNumber` values in INFO range (numeric 9-12)
will be mapped to Zapâ€™s "Info" level.

#### Error Semantics

If `SeverityNumber` is present and has a value of ERROR (numeric 17) or higher
then it is an indication that the log record represents an erroneous situation.
It is up to the reader of this value to make a decision on how to use this fact
(e.g. UIs may display such errors in a different color or have a feature to find
all erroneous log records).

If the log record represents an erroneous event and the source format does not
define a severity or log level concept then it is recommended to set
`SeverityNumber` to ERROR (numeric 17) during the mapping process. If the log
record represents a non-erroneous event the `SeverityNumber` field may be
omitted or may be set to any numeric value less than ERROR (numeric 17). The
recommended value in this case is INFO (numeric 9). See
[Appendix B](#appendix-b-severitynumber-example-mappings) for more mapping
examples.

#### Displaying Severity

The following table defines the recommended short name for each
`SeverityNumber` value. The short name can be used for example for representing
the `SeverityNumber` in the UI:

SeverityNumber|Short Name
--------------|----------
1             |TRACE
2             |TRACE2
3             |TRACE3
4             |TRACE4
5             |DEBUG
6             |DEBUG2
7             |DEBUG3
8             |DEBUG4
9             |INFO
10            |INFO2
11            |INFO3
12            |INFO4
13            |WARN
14            |WARN2
15            |WARN3
16            |WARN4
17            |ERROR
18            |ERROR2
19            |ERROR3
20            |ERROR4
21            |FATAL
22            |FATAL2
23            |FATAL3
24            |FATAL4

When an individual log record is displayed it is recommended to show both
`SeverityText` and `SeverityNumber` values. A recommended combined string in
this case begins with the short name followed by `SeverityText` in parenthesis.

For example "Informational" Syslog record will be displayed as **INFO
(Informational)**. When for a particular log record the `SeverityNumber` is
defined but the `SeverityText` is missing it is recommended to only show the
short name, e.g. **INFO**.

When drop down lists (or other UI elements that are intended to represent the
possible set of values) are used for representing the severity it is preferable
to display the short name in such UI elements.

For example a dropdown list of severities that allows filtering log records by
severities is likely to be more usable if it contains the short names of
`SeverityNumber` (and thus has a limited upper bound of elements) compared to a
dropdown list, which lists all distinct `SeverityText` values that are known to
the system (which can be a large number of elements, often differing only in
capitalization or abbreviated, e.g. "Info" vs "Information").

#### Comparing Severity

In the contexts where severity participates in less-than / greater-than
comparisons `SeverityNumber` field should be used. `SeverityNumber` can be
compared to another `SeverityNumber` or to numbers in the 1..24 range (or to the
corresponding short names).

### Field: `Name`

Type: string.

Description: Short event identifier that does not contain varying parts.
`Name` describes what happened (e.g. "ProcessStarted"). Recommended to be
no longer than 50 characters. Not guaranteed to be unique in any way. Typically
used for filtering and grouping purposes in backends. This field is optional.

### Field: `Body`

Type: any.

Description: A value containing the body of the log record (see the description
of `any` type above). Can be for example a human-readable string message
(including multi-line) describing the event in a free form or it can be a
structured data composed of arrays and maps of other values. Can vary for each
occurrence of the event coming from the same source. This field is optional.

### Field: `Resource`

Type: key/value pair list.

Description: Describes the source of the log, aka
[resource](../overview.md#resources).
"key" of each pair is a `string` and "value" is of `any` type. Multiple
occurrences of events coming from the same event source can happen across time
and they all have the same value of `Resource`. Can contain for example
information about the application that emits the record or about the
infrastructure where the application runs. Data formats that represent this data
model may be designed in a manner that allows the `Resource` field to be
recorded only once per batch of log records that come from the same source.
SHOULD follow OpenTelemetry
[semantic conventions for Resources](../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md).
This field is optional.

### Field: `Attributes`

Type: key/value pair list.

Description: Additional information about the specific event occurrence. "key"
of each pair is a `string` and "value" is of `any` type. Unlike the `Resource`
field, which is fixed for a particular source, `Attributes` can vary for each
occurrence of the event coming from the same source. Can contain information
about the request context (other than TraceId/SpanId). SHOULD follow
OpenTelemetry
[semantic conventions for Attributes](../trace/semantic_conventions/README.md).
This field is optional.

## Example Log Records

Below are examples that show one possible representation of log records in JSON.
These are just examples to help understand the data model. Donâ€™t treat the
examples as _the_ way to represent this data model in JSON.

This document does not define the actual encoding and format of the log record
representation. Format definitions will be done in separate OTEPs (e.g. the log
records may be represented as msgpack, JSON, Protocol Buffer messages, etc).

Example 1

```javascript
{
  "Timestamp": 1586960586000, // JSON needs to make a decision about
                              // how to represent nanoseconds.
  "Attributes": {
    "http.status_code": 500,
    "http.url": "http://example.com",
    "my.custom.application.tag": "hello",
  },
  "Resource": {
    "service.name": "donut_shop",
    "service.version": "2.0.0",
    "k8s.pod.uid": "1138528c-c36e-11e9-a1a7-42010a800198",
  },
  "TraceId": "f4dbb3edd765f620", // this is a byte sequence
                                 // (hex-encoded in JSON)
  "SpanId": "43222c2d51a7abe3",
  "SeverityText": "INFO",
  "SeverityNumber": 9,
  "Body": "20200415T072306-0700 INFO I like donuts"
}
```

Example 2

```javascript
{
  "Timestamp": 1586960586000,
  ...
  "Body": {
    "i": "am",
    "an": "event",
    "of": {
      "some": "complexity"
    }
  }
}
```

Example 3

```javascript
{
   "Timestamp": 1586960586000,
   "Attributes":{
      "http.scheme":"https",
      "http.host":"donut.mycie.com",
      "http.target":"/order",
      "http.method":"post",
      "http.status_code":500,
      "http.flavor":"1.1",
      "http.user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36",
   }
}
```
