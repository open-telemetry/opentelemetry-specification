# Log Attribute Semantic Conventions

**Status**: [Experimental](../../document-status.md)

The following semantic conventions for logs are defined:

* [Log Media](media.md): Semantic attributes that may be used in describing the source of a log.

The following semantic conventions for events are defined:

* [Events](events.md): Semantic attributes that must be used to represent Events using log data model.

Apart from semantic conventions for logs, [traces](../../trace/semantic_conventions/README.md), and [metrics](../../metrics/semantic_conventions/README.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](../../resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](../../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md).
