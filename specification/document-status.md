# Definitions of Document Statuses

Specification documents (files) may explicitly define a "Status", typically
shown immediately after the document title. When present, the "Status" applies
to the individual document only and not to the entire specification or any other
documents. The following table describes what the statuses mean.

|Status              |Explanation|
|--------------------|-----------|
|No explicit "Status"|Working draft, can change any time.|
|Feature-freeze      |Document is no longer accepting new substantial changes, except when such changes are necessary to resolve a fundamental problem or inconsistency in the specification. Editorial changes are accepted. The document and the area it describes are considered feature-complete for the version of the specification the document targets. The document in this status is ready for implementation.|
