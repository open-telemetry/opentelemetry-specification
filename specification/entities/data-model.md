Entity represents an object of interest associated with produced telemetry:
traces, metrics, profiles, or logs.

For example, telemetry produced using an OpenTelemetry SDK is normally
associated with a `service` entity. Similarly, OpenTelemetry defines system
metrics for a `host`. The `host` is the entity we want to associate metrics with
in this case.

Entities may be also associated with produced telemetry indirectly.
For example a service that produces
telemetry is also related to a process in which the service runs, so we say that
the `service` entity is related to the `process` entity. The process normally
also runs on a host, so we say that the `process` entity is related to the
`host` entity.

> Note: Entity relationship modelling will be refined in future specification
> work.

The data model below defines a logical model for an entity (irrespective of the
physical format and encoding of how entity data is recorded).

## Minimally Sufficient Identity

Commonly, a number of attributes of an entity are readily available for the telemetry
producer to compose an Id from. Of the available attributes the entity Id should
include the minimal set of attributes that is sufficient for uniquely identifying
that entity. For example a Process on a host can be uniquely identified by
(`process.pid`,`process.start_time`) attributes. Adding for example `process.executable.name` attribute to the Id is unnecessary and violates the
Minimally Sufficient Identity rule.

## Repeatable Identity

The identifying attributes for entity SHOULD be values that can be repeatably
obtained by observers of that entity. For example, a `process` entity SHOULD
have the same identity (and be recognized as the same process), regardless of whether
the identity was generated from the process itself, e.g. via SDK, or by an
OpenTelemetry Collector running on the same host, or by some other system
describing the process.

> Aside: There are many ways to accomplish repeatable identifying attributes
> across multiple observers. While many successful systems rely on pushing down
> identity from a central registry or knowledge store, OpenTelemetry must
> support all possible scenarios.

## Examples of Entities

_This section is non-normative and is present only for the purposes of
demonstrating the data model._

Here are examples of entities, the typical identifying attributes they
have and some examples of descriptive attributes that may be
associated with the entity.

_Note: These examples MAY diverge from semantic conventions._
