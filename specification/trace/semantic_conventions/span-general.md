# General attributes

The attributes described in this section are not specific to a particular operation but rather generic.
They may be used in any Span they apply to.
Particular operations may refer to or require some of these attributes.

## General network connection attributes

These attributes may be used for any network related operation.
The `net.peer.*` attributes describe properties of the remote end of the network connection
(usually the transport-layer peer, e.g. the node to which a TCP connection was established),
while the `net.host.*` properties describe the local end.
In an ideal situation, not accounting for proxies, multiple IP addresses or host names,
the `net.peer.*` properties of a client are equal to the `net.host.*` properties of the server and vice versa.

<a name="nettransport-attribute">

<!-- semconv network -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Example  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `net.transport` | string enum | Transport protocol used. See note below. | `IP.TCP` | No |
| `net.peer.ip` | string | Remote address of the peer (dotted decimal for IPv4 or [RFC5952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952) for IPv6) | `127.0.0.1` | No |
| `net.peer.port` | number | Remote port number. | `80`<br>`8080`<br>`443` | No |
| `net.peer.name` | string | Remote hostname or similar, see note below. | `example.com` | No |
| `net.host.ip` | string | Like `net.peer.ip` but for the host IP. Useful in case of a multi-IP host. | `192.168.0.1` | No |
| `net.host.port` | number | Like `net.peer.port` but for the host port. | `35555` | No |
| `net.host.name` | string | Local hostname or similar, see note below. | `localhost` | No |

`net.transport` MUST be one of the following:

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `IP.TCP` | IP.TCP |
| `IP.UDP` | IP.UDP |
| `IP` | Another IP-based protocol |
| `Unix` | Unix Domain socket. See below. |
| `pipe` | Named or anonymous pipe. See note below. |
| `inproc` | In-process communication. [1] |
| `other` | Something else (non IP-based). |

**[1]:** Signals that there is only in-process communication not using a "real" network protocol in cases where network attributes would normally be expected. Usually all other network attributes can be left out in that case.

<!-- endsemconv -->
For `Unix` and `pipe`, since the connection goes over the file system instead of being directly to a known peer, `net.peer.name` is the only attribute that usually makes sense (see description of `net.peer.name` below).

<a name="net.name"></a>

### `net.*.name` attributes

For IP-based communication, the name should be a DNS host name.
For `net.peer.name`, this should be the name that was used to look up the IP address that was connected to
(i.e., matching `net.peer.ip` if that one is set; e.g., `"example.com"` if connecting to an URL `https://example.com/foo`).
If only the IP address but no host name is available, reverse-lookup of the IP may optionally be used to obtain it.
`net.host.name` should be the host name of the local host,
preferably the one that the peer used to connect for the current operation.
If that is not known, a public hostname should be preferred over a private one. However, in that case it may be redundant with information already contained in resources and may be left out.
It will usually not make sense to use reverse-lookup to obtain `net.host.name`, as that would result in static information that is better stored as resource information.

If `net.transport` is `"unix"` or `"pipe"`, the absolute path to the file representing it should be used as `net.peer.name` (`net.host.name` doesn't make sense in that context).
If there is no such file (e.g., anonymous pipe),
the name should explicitly be set to the empty string to distinguish it from the case where the name is just unknown or not covered by the instrumentation.

## General remote service attributes

This attribute may be used for any operation that accesses some remote service.
Users can define what the name of a service is based on their particular semantics in their distributed system.
Instrumentations SHOULD provide a way for users to configure this name.

<!-- semconv peer -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Example  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `peer.service` | string | The [`service.name`](../../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md#service) of the remote service. SHOULD be equal to the actual `service.name` resource attribute of the remote service if any. | `AuthTokenCache` | No |
<!-- endsemconv -->

Examples of `peer.service` that users may specify:

- A Redis cache of auth tokens as `peer.service="AuthTokenCache"`.
- A gRPC service `rpc.service="io.opentelemetry.AuthService"` may be hosted in both a gateway, `peer.service="ExternalApiService"` and a backend, `peer.service="AuthService"`.

## General identity attributes

These attributes may be used for any operation with an authenticated and/or authorized enduser.

<!-- semconv identity -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Example  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `enduser.id` | string | Username or client_id extracted from the access token or [Authorization](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-4.2) header in the inbound request from outside the system. | `username` | No |
| `enduser.role` | string | Actual/assumed role the client is making the request under extracted from token or application security context. | `admin` | No |
| `enduser.scope` | string | Scopes or granted authorities the client currently possesses extracted from token or application security context. The value would come from the scope associated with an [OAuth 2.0 Access Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3) or an attribute value in a [SAML 2.0 Assertion](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html). | `read:message, write:files` | No |
<!-- endsemconv -->

These attributes describe the authenticated user driving the user agent making requests to the instrumented
system. It is expected this information would be propagated unchanged from node-to-node within the system
using the Baggage mechanism. These attributes should not be used to record system-to-system
authentication attributes.

Examples of where the `enduser.id` value is extracted from:

| Authentication protocol | Field or description            |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| [HTTP Basic/Digest Authentication] | `username`               |
| [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token] | [OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier] value from `client_id` for the [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant] flow and `subject` or `username` from get token info response for other flows using opaque tokens. |
| [OpenID Connect 1.0 IDToken] | `sub` |
| [SAML 2.0 Assertion] | `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion:Subject` |
| [Kerberos] | `PrincipalName` |

| Framework               | Field or description            |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| [JavaEE/JakartaEE Servlet] | `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal()` |
| [Windows Communication Foundation] | `ServiceSecurityContext.Current.PrimaryIdentity` |

[Authorization]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-4.2

Given the sensitive nature of this information, SDKs and exporters SHOULD drop these attributes by
default and then provide a configuration parameter to turn on retention for use cases where the
information is required and would not violate any policies or regulations.

## General thread attributes

These attributes may be used for any operation to store information about
a thread that started a span.

| Attribute name | Notes and examples                                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `thread.id`    | Current "managed" thread ID (as opposed to OS thread ID). E.g. `42` |
| `thread.name`  | Current thread name. E.g. `main`                                    |

Examples of where `thread.id` and `thread.name` can be extracted from:

| Launguage or platform | `thread.id`                            | `thread.name`                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| JVM                   | `Thread.currentThread().getId()`       | `Thread.currentThread().getName()` |
| .Net                  | `Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId` | `Thread.CurrentThread.Name`        |
| Python                | `threading.current_thread().ident`     | `threading.current_thread().name`  |
| Ruby                  |                                        | `Thread.current.name`              |
| C++                   | `std::this_thread::get_id()`             |                                    |
| Erlang               | `erlang:system_info(scheduler_id)` |                                  |

## Source Code Attributes

Often a span is closely tied to a certain unit of code that is logically responsible for handling
the operation that the span describes (usually the method that starts the span).
For an HTTP server span, this would be the function that handles the incoming request, for example.
The attributes listed below allow to report this unit of code and therefore to provide more context
about the span.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Example  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `code.function` | string | The method or function name, or equivalent (usually rightmost part of the code unit's name). | `serveRequest` | No |
| `code.namespace` | string | The "namespace" within which `code.function` is defined. Usually the qualified class or module name, such that `code.namespace` + some separator + `code.function` form a unique identifier for the code unit. | `com.example.MyHttpService` | No |
| `code.filepath` | string | The source code file name that identifies the code unit as uniquely as possible (preferably an absolute file path). | `/usr/local/MyApplication/src/main/java/com/example/MyHttpService.java` | No |
| `code.lineno` | number | The line number in `code.filepath` best representing the operation. It SHOULD point within the code unit named in `code.function`. | `42` | No |
