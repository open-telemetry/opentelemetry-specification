(also called "remote method invocations" / "RMI") with spans.

## Common remote procedure call conventions

A remote procedure calls is described by two separate spans, one on the client-side and one on the server-side.

For outgoing requests, the `SpanKind` MUST be set to `CLIENT` and for incoming requests to `SERVER`.

Remote procedure calls can only be represented with these semantic conventions, when the names of the called service and method are known and available.

### Span name

The _span name_ MUST be the full RPC method name formatted as:

```
$package.$service/$method
```

(where $service MUST NOT contain dots and $method MUST NOT contain slashes)

If there is no package name or if it is unknown, the `$package.` part (including the period) is omitted.

Examples of span names:

- `grpc.test.EchoService/Echo`
- `com.example.ExampleRmiService/exampleMethod`
- `MyCalcService.Calculator/Add` reported by the server and
  `MyServiceReference.ICalculator/Add` reported by the client for .NET WCF calls
- `MyServiceWithNoPackage/theMethod`

### Attributes

<!-- semconv rpc -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rpc.system` | string | A string identifying the remoting system. | `grpc`; `java_rmi`; `wcf` | Yes |
| `rpc.service` | string | The full name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable. | `myservice.EchoService` | No, but recommended |
| `rpc.method` | string | The name of the method being called, must be equal to the $method part in the span name. | `exampleMethod` | No, but recommended |
| [`net.peer.ip`](span-general.md) | string | Remote address of the peer (dotted decimal for IPv4 or [RFC5952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952) for IPv6) | `127.0.0.1` | See below |
| [`net.peer.name`](span-general.md) | string | Remote hostname or similar, see note below. | `example.com` | See below |
| [`net.peer.port`](span-general.md) | number | Remote port number. | `80`; `8080`; `443` | See below |
| [`net.transport`](span-general.md) | string | Transport protocol used. See note below. | `IP.TCP` | See below |

**Additional attribute requirements:** At least one of the following sets of attributes is required:

* [`net.peer.ip`](span-general.md)
* [`net.peer.name`](span-general.md)
<!-- endsemconv -->

For client-side spans `net.peer.port` is required if the connection is IP-based and the port is available (it describes the server port they are connecting to).
For server-side spans `net.peer.port` is optional (it describes the port the client is connecting from).
Furthermore, setting [net.transport][] is required for non-IP connection like named pipe bindings.

#### Service name

On the server process receiving and handling the remote procedure call, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not necessarily have to match the [`service.name`][] resource attribute.
One process can expose multiple RPC endpoints and thus have multiple RPC service names. From a deployment perspective, as expressed by the `service.*` resource attributes, it will be treated as one deployed service with one `service.name`.
Likewise, on clients sending RPC requests to a server, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not have to match the [`peer.service`][] span attribute.

As an example, given a process deployed as `QuoteService`, this would be the name that goes into the `service.name` resource attribute which applies to the entire process.
This process could expose two RPC endpoints, one called `CurrencyQuotes` (= `rpc.service`) with a method called `getMeanRate` (= `rpc.method`) and the other endpoint called `StockQuotes`  (= `rpc.service`) with two methods `getCurrentBid` and `getLastClose` (= `rpc.method`).
In this example, spans representing client request should have their `peer.service` attribute set to `QuoteService` as well to match the server's `service.name` resource attribute.
Generally, a user SHOULD NOT set `peer.service` to a fully qualified RPC service name.

### Distinction from HTTP spans

HTTP calls can generally be represented using just [HTTP spans](./http.md).
If they address a particular remote service and method known to the caller, i.e., when it is a remote procedure call transported over HTTP, the `rpc.*` attributes might be added additionally on that span, or in a separate RPC span that is a parent of the transporting HTTP call.
Note that _method_ in this context is about the called remote procedure and _not_ the HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.).

## gRPC

For remote procedure calls via [gRPC][], additional conventions are described in this section.

`rpc.system` MUST be set to `"grpc"`.

### gRPC Attributes

<!-- semconv rpc.grpc -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rpc.grpc.status_code` | number | The [numeric status code](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.33.2/doc/statuscodes.md) of the gRPC request. | `0`; `1`; `16` | Yes |

`rpc.grpc.status_code` MUST be one of the following:

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `0` | OK |
| `1` | CANCELLED |
| `2` | UNKNOWN |
| `3` | INVALID_ARGUMENT |
| `4` | DEADLINE_EXCEEDED |
| `5` | NOT_FOUND |
| `6` | ALREADY_EXISTS |
| `7` | PERMISSION_DENIED |
| `8` | RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED |
| `9` | FAILED_PRECONDITION |
| `10` | ABORTED |
| `11` | OUT_OF_RANGE |
| `12` | UNIMPLEMENTED |
| `13` | INTERNAL |
| `14` | UNAVAILABLE |
| `15` | DATA_LOSS |
| `16` | UNAUTHENTICATED |
<!-- endsemconv -->

### gRPC Status

The [Span Status](../api.md#set-status) MUST be left unset for an `OK` gRPC status code, and set to `Error` for all others.

### Events

In the lifetime of a gRPC stream, an event for each message sent/received on
client and server spans SHOULD be created with the following attributes:

```
-> [time],
    "name" = "message",
    "message.type" = "SENT",
    "message.id" = id
    "message.compressed_size" = <compressed size in bytes>,
    "message.uncompressed_size" = <uncompressed size in bytes>
```

```
-> [time],
    "name" = "message",
    "message.type" = "RECEIVED",
    "message.id" = id
    "message.compressed_size" = <compressed size in bytes>,
    "message.uncompressed_size" = <uncompressed size in bytes>
```

The `message.id` MUST be calculated as two different counters starting from `1`
one for sent messages and one for received message. This way we guarantee that
the values will be consistent between different implementations. In case of
unary calls only one sent and one received message will be recorded for both
client and server spans.
