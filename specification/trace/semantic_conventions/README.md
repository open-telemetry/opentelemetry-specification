# Trace Semantic Conventions

**Status**: [Experimental](../../document-status.md)

In OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and itâ€™s up to the implementor to
annotate them with attributes specific to the represented operation. Spans
represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls.
Depending on the protocol and the type of operation, additional information
is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages.
This way, the operator will not need to learn specifics of a language and
telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments
can still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.

The following semantic conventions for spans are defined:

* [General](span-general.md): General semantic attributes that may be used in describing different kinds of operations.
* [HTTP](http.md): Spans for HTTP client and server.
* [Database](database.md): Spans for SQL and NoSQL client calls.
* [RPC/RMI](rpc.md): Spans for remote procedure calls (e.g., gRPC).
* [Messaging](messaging.md): Spans for interaction with messaging systems (queues, publish/subscribe, etc.).
* [FaaS](faas.md): Spans for Function as a Service (e.g., AWS Lambda).
* [Exceptions](exceptions.md): Attributes for recording exceptions associated with a span

Apart from semantic conventions for traces and [metrics](../../metrics/semantic_conventions/README.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](../../resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](../../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md).
