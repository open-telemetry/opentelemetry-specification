# CloudEvents

**Status**: [Experimental](../../document-status.md)

This specification defines semantic conventions for [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/). It covers creation, processing and context propagation between producer and consumer. It does not cover transport aspects of publishing and receiving cloud events.

## Overview

To be individually traceable, each CloudEvent has to have its own trace context. The trace context is populated in the event using the [Distributed Tracing Extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/extensions/distributed-tracing.md).

Once the trace context is set on the event, it MUST not be modified.

## Spans

### Creation

Instrumentation SHOULD create a new span and populate the [Distributed Tracing Extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/extensions/distributed-tracing.md) on the event. This applies when:

- A CloudEvent is created by the instrumented library. It may be impossible or impractical to create the Span during event creation (e.g. inside the constructor or in a factory method) - instrumentation MAY create the Span later, when passing the event to the transport layer.
- A CloudEvent is created outside of the instrumented library (e.g. directly constructed by the application owner, without calling a constructor or factory method), and passed without the Distributed Tracing Extension populated.

In case a CloudEvent is passed to the instrumented library with the Distributed Tracing Extension populated, instrumentation MUST NOT create a span and MUST NOT modify the Distributed Tracing Extension on the event.

**Span name:** `CloudEvents Create <event_type>`
**Span kind:** PRODUCER

### Processing

When instrumented library supports processing of a single CloudEvent, instrumentation SHOULD create a new span to trace it. Instrumentation SHOULD set the remote trace context from the Distributed Tracing Extension as a link on the processing span.

**Span name:** `CloudEvents Process <event_type>`
**Span kind:** CONSUMER

Note: CloudEvents processing does not follow a common pattern. Some "CloudEvents-enabled" libraries expose handlers for processing (e.g.  [CloudEvents Go SDK](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go#receive-your-first-cloudevent)) and can auto-instrument the processing calls. Alternatively, a library might offer a handler, but the user chooses not to use it, or a library does not offer one at all. In such cases, the instrumentation responsibility falls under the application owner.

## Attributes

The following attributes are applicable to creation and processing Spans.

<!-- semconv cloudevents -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cloudevents.event_id` | string | The [event_id](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#id) uniquely identifies the event. [1] | `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`; `0001` | No |
| `cloudevents.event_source` | string | The [source](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#source-1) identifies the context in which an event happened. | `https://github.com/cloudevents`; `/cloudevents/spec/pull/123`; `my-service` | No |
| `cloudevents.event_spec_version` | string | The [version of the CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#specversion) which the event uses. | `1.0` | No |
| `cloudevents.event_type` | string | The [event_type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#type) contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence. | `com.github.pull_request.opened`; `com.example.object.deleted.v2` | No |
| `cloudevents.event_subject` | string | The [subject](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#subject) of the event in the context of the event producer (identified by source). | `mynewfile.jpg` | No |

**[1]:** Producers MUST ensure that event_source + event_id is unique for each distinct event. If a duplicate event is re-sent (e.g. due to a network error) it MAY have the same id. Consumers MAY assume that Events with identical event_source and event_id are duplicates.
