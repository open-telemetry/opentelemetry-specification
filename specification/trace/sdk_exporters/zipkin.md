# OpenTelemetry to Zipkin Transformation

This document defines the transformation between OpenTelemetry and Zipkin Spans.
Zipkin's v2 API is defined in the
[zipkin.proto](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/zipkin.proto)

## Summary

The following table summarizes the major transformations between OpenTelemetry
and Zipkin.

TBD : This is work in progress document and it is currently doesn't specify
mapping for these fields:

OpenTelemetry fields:

- Resource attributes
- Tracestate
- Links
- LocalChildSpanCount
- dropped attributes count
- dropped events count
- dropped links count

Zipkin fields:

- Service name
- Local_endpoint
- Remote_endpoint
- debug
- Shared

## Mappings

This section discusses the details of the transformations between OpenTelemetry
and Zipkin.

### SpanKind

The following table lists all the `SpanKind` mappings between OpenTelemetry and
Zipkin.

| OpenTelemetry | Zipkin | Note |
| ------------- | ------ | ---- |
| `SpanKind.CLIENT`|`SpanKind.CLIENT`||
| `SpanKind.SERVER`|`SpanKind.SERVER`||
| `SpanKind.CONSUMER`|`SpanKind.CONSUMER`||
| `SpanKind.PRODUCER`|`SpanKind.PRODUCER` ||
|`SpanKind.INTERNAL`|`null` |must be omitted (set to `null`)|

### Attribute

OpenTelemetry Span `Attribute`(s) MUST be reported as `tags` to Zipkin.
Primitive types MUST be converted to string using en-US culture settings.
Boolean values must use lower case strings `"true"` and `"false"`, except an
attribute named `error`. In case if value of the attribute is `false`, Zipkin
tag needs to be omitted.

Array values MUST be serialized to string like a JSON list as mentioned in
[semantic conventions](../../overview.md#semantic-conventions).

TBD: add examples

### Status

Span `Status` MUST be reported as a key-value pair in `tags` to Zipkin.

The following table defines the OpenTelemetry `Status` to Zipkin `tags` mapping.

| Status|Tag Key| Tag Value |
|--|--|--|
|Code | `ot.status_code` | Name of the code, for example: `OK` |
|Message *(optional)* | `ot.status_description` | `{message}` |

The `ot.status_code` tag value MUST follow the [Standard GRPC Code
Names](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md).

### Events

OpenTelemetry `Event` has an optional `Attribute`(s) which is not supported by
Zipkin. Events MUST be converted to the Annotations with the names which will
include attribute values like this:

```
"my-event-name": { "key1" : "value1", "key2": "value2" }
```

### Unit of Time

Zipkin times like `timestamp`, `duration` and `annotation.timestamp` MUST be
reported in microseconds with decimal accuracy. For example, `duration` of 1234
nanoseconds will be represented as 1.234 microseconds.

## Request Payload

For performance considerations, Zipkin fields that can be absent SHOULD be
omitted from the payload when they are empty in the OpenTelemetry `Span`.

For example, an OpenTelemetry `Span` without any `Event` should not have an
`annotations` field in the Zipkin payload.

## Considerations for Legacy (v1) Format

Zipkin's v2 [json](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/zipkin2-api.yaml) format was defined in 2017, followed up by a [protobuf](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/zipkin.proto) format in 2018.

Frameworks made before then use a more complex v1 [Thrift](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/thrift/zipkinCore.thrift) or [json](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/zipkin-api.yaml) format that notably differs in so far as it uses terminology such as Binary Annotation, and repeats endpoint information on each attribute.

Consider using [V1SpanConverter.java](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin/src/main/java/zipkin2/v1/V1SpanConverter.java) as a reference implementation for converting v1 model to OpenTelemetry.

The span timestamp and duration were late additions to the V1 format. As in the code link above, it is possible to heuristically derive them from annotations.
