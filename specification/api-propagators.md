Propagators API currently consists of one format:

- `HTTPTextFormat` is used to inject and extract a value as text into carriers that travel
  in-band across process boundaries.

Deserializing must set `IsRemote` to true on the returned `SpanContext`.

A binary format will be added in the future.

## HTTP Text Format

`HTTPTextFormat` is a formatter that injects and extracts a value as text into carriers that
travel in-band across process boundaries.

Encoding is expected to conform to the HTTP Header Field semantics. Values are often encoded as
RPC/HTTP request headers.

The carrier of propagated data on both the client (injector) and server (extractor) side is
usually an http request. Propagation is usually implemented via library-specific request
interceptors, where the client-side injects values and the server-side extracts them.

`HTTPTextFormat` MUST expose the APIs that injects values into carriers,
and extracts values from carriers.

### Fields

The propagation fields defined. If your carrier is reused, you should delete the fields here
before calling [inject](#inject).

For example, if the carrier is a single-use or immutable request object, you don't need to
clear fields as they couldn't have been set before. If it is a mutable, retryable object,
successive calls should clear these fields first.

The use cases of this are:

- allow pre-allocation of fields, especially in systems like gRPC Metadata
- allow a single-pass over an iterator

Returns list of fields that will be used by this formatter.

### Inject

Injects the value downstream. For example, as http headers.

Required arguments:

- the value to be injected, can be `SpanContext` or `DistributedContext`.
- the carrier that holds propagation fields. For example, an outgoing message or http request.
- the `Setter` invoked for each propagation key to add or remove.

#### Setter argument

Setter is an argument in `Inject` that puts value into given field.

`Setter` allows a `HTTPTextFormat` to set propagated fields into a carrier.

`Setter` MUST be stateless and allowed to be saved as a constant to avoid runtime allocations. One of the ways to implement it is `Setter` class with `Put` method as described below.

##### Put

Replaces a propagated field with the given value.

Required arguments:

- the carrier holds propagation fields. For example, an outgoing message or http request.
- the key of the field.
- the value of the field.

The implemenation SHOULD preserve casing (e.g. it should not transform `Content-Type` to `content-type`) if the used protocol is case insensitive, otherwise it MUST preserve casing.

### Extract

Extracts the value from upstream. For example, as http headers.

If the value could not be parsed, the underlying implementation will decide to return an
object representing either an empty value, an invalid value, or a valid value. Implementations
MUST not return null.

Required arguments:

- the carrier holds propagation fields. For example, an outgoing message or http request.
- the instance of `Getter` invoked for each propagation key to get.

Returns the non-null extracted value.

#### Getter argument

Getter is an argument in `Extract` that get value from given field

`Getter` allows a `HttpTextFormat` to read propagated fields from a carrier.

`Getter` MUST be stateless and allowed to be saved as a constant to avoid runtime allocations. One of the ways to implement it is `Getter` class with `Get` method as described below.

##### Get

The Get function MUST return the first value of the given propagation key or return null if the key doesn't exist.

Required arguments:

- the carrier of propagation fields, such as an HTTP request.
- the key of the field.

The Get function is responsible for handling case sensitivity. If the getter is intended to work with a HTTP request object, the getter MUST be case insensitive. To improve compatibility with other text-based protocols, text format implemenations MUST ensure to always use the canonical casing for their attributes. NOTE: Cannonical casing for HTTP headers is usually title case (e.g. `Content-Type` instead of `content-type`).
