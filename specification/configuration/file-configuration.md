## Overview

File configuration provides a mechanism for configuring OpenTelemetry which is
more expressive and full-featured than
the [environment variable](sdk-environment-variables.md) based scheme, and
language agnostic in a way not possible
with [programmatic configuration](sdk-configuration.md#programmatic).

File configuration defines a [Configuration Model](#configuration-model),
which can be expressed in a [configuration file](#configuration-file).
Configuration files can be validated against the Configuration Schema, and
interpreted to produce configured OpenTelemetry components.

## Configuration Model

The configuration model is defined
in [opentelemetry-configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-configuration)
using the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

### Stability Definition

TODO: define stability guarantees and backwards compatibility

## Configuration file

A configuration file is a file representation of
the [Configuration Model](#configuration-model).

TODO: define acceptable file formats

TODO: define environment variable substitution

## SDK Configuration

SDK configuration defines the interfaces and operations that SDKs are expected
to expose to enable file based configuration.

### In-Memory Configuration Model

SDKs SHOULD provide an in-memory representation of
the [Configuration Model](#configuration-model). In general, SDKs are encouraged
to provide this in-memory representation in a manner that is idiomatic for their
language. If an SDK needs to expose a class or interface, the
name `Configuration` is RECOMMENDED.

### Operations

SDK implementations of configuration MUST provide the following operations.

Note: Because these operations are stateless pure functions, they are not
defined as part of any type, class, interface, etc. SDKs may organize them in
whatever manner is idiomatic for the language.

TODO: Add operation to update SDK components with new configuration for usage
with OpAmp

#### Parse

Parse and validate a [configuration file](#configuration-file).

**Parameters:**

* `file`: The [configuration file](#configuration-file) to parse. This MAY be a
  file path, or language specific file data structure, or a stream of a file's content.

**Returns:** [configuration model](#in-memory-configuration-model)

This SHOULD return an error if:

* The `file` doesn't exist or is invalid
* The parsed `file` content does not conform to
  the [configuration model](#configuration-model) schema.

TODO: define behavior if some portion of configuration model is not supported

#### Create

Interpret [configuration model](#in-memory-configuration-model) and return SDK components.

**Parameters:**

* `configuration` - The configuration model.

**Returns:** Top level SDK components:

* `TracerProvider`
* `MeterProvider`
* `LoggerProvider`
* `Propagators`

The multiple responses MAY be returned using a tuple, or some other data
structure encapsulating the components.

This SHOULD return an error if it encounters an error in `configuration` (i.e.
fail fast).
