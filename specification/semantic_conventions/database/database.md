## Requirements

**Span kind:** MUST always be `CLIENT`.

The **span name** SHOULD be set to a low cardinality value representing the statement executed on the database.
It MAY be a stored procedure name (without arguments, DB statement without variable arguments, operation name, etc.

When it's otherwise impossible to get any meaningful span name, `db.name` MAY be used.

## Connection-level attributes

These attributes will usually be the same for all operations performed over the same database connection.
Some database systems may allow a connection to switch to a different `db.user`, for example, and other database systems may not even have the concept of a connection at all.

<!-- semconv db(tag=connection-level) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `db.system` | string | An identifier for the database management system (DBMS) product being used. See below for a list of well-known identifiers. | `other_sql` | Yes |
| `db.connection_string` | string | The connection string used to connect to the database. It is recommended to remove embedded credentials. | `Server=(localdb)\v11.0;Integrated Security=true;` | No |
| `db.user` | string | Username for accessing the database. | `readonly_user`; `reporting_user` | No |
| [`net.peer.ip`](../networking/networking.md) | string | Remote address of the peer (dotted decimal for IPv4 or [RFC5952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952) for IPv6) | `127.0.0.1` | See below. |
| [`net.peer.name`](../networking/networking.md) | string | Remote hostname or similar, see note below. | `example.com` | See below. |
| [`net.peer.port`](../networking/networking.md) | int | Remote port number. | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Conditional [1] |
| [`net.transport`](../networking/networking.md) | string | Transport protocol used. See note below. | `ip_tcp` | Conditional [2] |

**[1]:** Required if using a port other than the default port for this DBMS.

**[2]:** Recommended in general, required for in-process databases (`"inproc"`).

**Additional attribute requirements:** At least one of the following sets of attributes is required:

* [`net.peer.name`](../networking/networking.md)
* [`net.peer.ip`](../networking/networking.md)

`db.system` MUST be one of the following or, if none of the listed values apply, a custom value:

### Notes and well-known identifiers for `db.system`

The list above is a non-exhaustive list of well-known identifiers to be specified for `db.system`.

If a value defined in this list applies to the DBMS to which the request is sent, this value MUST be used.
If no value defined in this list is suitable, a custom value MUST be provided.
This custom value MUST be the name of the DBMS in lowercase and without a version number to stay consistent with existing identifiers.

It is encouraged to open a PR towards this specification to add missing values to the list, especially when instrumentations for those missing databases are written.
This allows multiple instrumentations for the same database to be aligned and eases analyzing for backends.

The value `other_sql` is intended as a fallback and MUST only be used if the DBMS is known to be SQL-compliant but the concrete product is not known to the instrumentation.
If the concrete DBMS is known to the instrumentation, its specific identifier MUST be used.

Back ends could, for example, use the provided identifier to determine the appropriate SQL dialect for parsing the `db.statement`.

When additional attributes are added that only apply to a specific DBMS, its identifier SHOULD be used as a namespace in the attribute key as for the attributes in the sections below.

## Call-level attributes

These attributes may be different for each operation performed, even if the same connection is used for multiple operations.
Usually only one `db.name` will be used per connection though.

<!-- semconv db(tag=call-level,remove_constraints) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `db.name` | string | This attribute is used to report the name of the database being accessed. For commands that switch the database, this should be set to the target database (even if the command fails). | `customers`; `main` | Conditional [1] |
| `db.statement` | string | The database statement being executed. [2] | `SELECT * FROM wuser_table`; `SET mykey "WuValue"` | Conditional [3] |
| `db.operation` | string | The name of the operation being executed. | `findAndModify`; `HMSET`; `SELECT` | Required, if `db.statement` is not applicable. |

**[1]:** Required if applicable and no more-specific attribute is defined.

**[2]:** The value may be sanitized to exclude sensitive information.

**[3]:** Required if applicable and not explicitly disabled via instrumentation configuration.
