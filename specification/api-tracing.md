Tracing API consist of a few main classes:

- `Tracer` is used for all operations. See [Tracer](#tracer) section.
- `Span` is a mutable object storing information about the current operation
   execution. See [Span](#span) section.

## Data types

While languages and platforms have different ways of representing data,
this section defines some generic requirements for this API.

### Time

OpenTelemetry can operate on time values up to nanosecond (ns) precision.
The representation of those values is language specific.

#### Timestamp

A timestamp is the time elapsed since the Unix epoch.

* The minimal precision is milliseconds.
* The maximal precision is nanoseconds.

#### Duration

A duration is the elapsed time between two events.

* The minimal precision is milliseconds.
* The maximal precision is nanoseconds.

## Tracer

The OpenTelemetry library achieves in-process context propagation of `Span`s by
way of the `Tracer`.

The `Tracer` is responsible for tracking the currently active `Span`, and
exposes methods for creating and activating new `Span`s. The `Tracer` is
configured with `Propagator`s which support transferring span context across
process boundaries.

`Tracer`s are generally expected to be used as singletons. Implementations
SHOULD provide a single global default `Tracer`.

Some applications may require multiple `Tracer` instances, e.g. to create
`Span`s on behalf of other applications. Implementations MAY provide a global
registry of `Tracer`s for such applications.

### Obtaining a Tracer

New `Tracer` instances can be created via a `TracerFactory` and its `getTracer`
method. This method expects two string arguments:

- `name` (required): This name must identify the instrumentation library (also
  referred to as integration, e.g. `io.opentelemetry.contrib.mongodb`) and *not*
  the instrumented library.
  In case an invalid name (null or empty string) is specified, a working
  default Tracer implementation as a fallback is returned rather than returning
  null or throwing an exception.
  A library, implementing the OpenTelemetry API *may* also ignore this name and
  return a default instance for all calls, if it does not support "named"
  functionality (e.g. an implementation which is not even observability-related).
  A TracerFactory could also return a no-op Tracer here if application owners configure
  the SDK to suppress telemetry produced by this library.
- `version` (optional): Specifies the version of the instrumentation library
  (e.g. `semver:1.0.0`).

Implementations might require the user to specify configuration properties at
`TracerFactory` creation time, or rely on external configuration, e.g. when using the
provider pattern.

#### Runtimes with multiple deployments/applications

Runtimes that support multiple deployments or applications might need to
provide a different `TracerFactory` instance to each deployment. To support this,
the global `TracerFactory` registry may delegate calls to create new instances of
`TracerFactory` to a separate `Provider` component, and the runtime may include
its own `Provider` implementation which returns a different `TracerFactory` for
each deployment.

`Provider` instances are registered with the API via some language-specific
mechanism, for instance the `ServiceLoader` class in Java.

### Tracer operations

The `Tracer` MUST provide methods to:

- Get the currently active `Span`
- Create a new `Span`
- Make a given `Span` as active

The `Tracer` SHOULD allow end users to configure other tracing components that
control how `Span`s are passed across process boundaries, including the binary
and text format `Propagator`s used to serialize `Span`s created by the
`Tracer`.

When getting the current span, the `Tracer` MUST return a placeholder `Span`
with an invalid `SpanContext` if there is no currently active `Span`.

When creating a new `Span`, the `Tracer` MUST allow the caller to specify the
new `Span`'s parent in the form of a `Span` or `SpanContext`. The `Tracer`
SHOULD create each new `Span` as a child of its active `Span` unless an
explicit parent is provided or the option to create a span without a parent is
selected, or the current active `Span` is invalid.

The `Tracer` MUST provide a way to update its active `Span`, and MAY provide
convenience methods to manage a `Span`'s lifetime and the scope in which a
`Span` is active. When an active `Span` is made inactive, the previously-active
`Span` SHOULD be made active. A `Span` maybe finished (i.e. have a non-null end
time) but stil active. A `Span` may be active on one thread after it has been
made inactive on another.

The implementation MUST provide no-op binary and text `Propagator`s, which the
`Tracer` SHOULD use by default if other propagators are not configured. SDKs
SHOULD use the W3C HTTP Trace Context as the default text format. For more
details, see [trace-context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context).

## SpanContext

A `SpanContext` represents the portion of a `Span` which must be serialized and
propagated along side of a distributed context. `SpanContext`s are immutable.
`SpanContext` MUST be a final (sealed) class.

The OpenTelemetry `SpanContext` representation conforms to the [w3c TraceContext
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/). It contains two
identifiers - a `TraceId` and a `SpanId` - along with a set of common
`TraceFlags` and system-specific `TraceState` values.

`TraceId` A valid trace identifier is a 16-byte array with at least one
non-zero byte.

`SpanId` A valid span identifier is an 8-byte array with at least one non-zero
byte.

`TraceFlags` contain details about the trace. Unlike Tracestate values,
TraceFlags are present in all traces. Currently, the only `TraceFlags` is a
boolean `sampled`
[flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-flags).

`Tracestate` carries system-specific configuration data, represented as a list
of key-value pairs. TraceState allows multiple tracing systems to participate in
the same trace.

`IsValid` is a boolean flag which returns true if the SpanContext has a non-zero
TraceID and a non-zero SpanID.

`IsRemote` is a boolean flag which returns true if the SpanContext was propagated
from a remote parent.

Please review the W3C specification for details on the [Tracestate
field](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#tracestate-field).

## Span

A `Span` represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to
form a trace tree. Each trace contains a root span, which typically describes
the end-to-end latency and, optionally, one or more sub-spans for its
sub-operations.

`Span`s encapsulate:

- The operation name
- An immutable [`SpanContext`](#spancontext) that uniquely identifies the
  `Span`
- A parent span in the form of a [`Span`](#span), [`SpanContext`](#spancontext),
  or null
- A start timestamp
- An end timestamp
- An ordered mapping of [`Attribute`s](#set-attributes)
- A list of [`Link`s](#add-links) to other `Span`s
- A list of timestamped [`Event`s](#add-events)
- A [`Status`](#set-status).

The `Span`'s start and end timestamps reflect the elapsed real time of the
operation. A `Span`'s start time SHOULD be set to the current time on [span
creation](#span-creation). After the `Span` is created, it SHOULD be possible to
change the its name, set its `Attribute`s, and add `Link`s and `Event`s. These
MUST NOT be changed after the `Span`'s end time has been set.

`Span`s are not meant to be used to propagate information within a process. To
prevent misuse, implementations SHOULD NOT provide access to a `Span`'s
attributes besides its `SpanContext`.

Vendors may implement the `Span` interface to effect vendor-specific logic.
However, alternative implementations MUST NOT allow callers to create `Span`s
directly. All `Span`s MUST be created via a `Tracer`.

### Span Creation

Implementations MUST provide a way to create `Span`s via a `Tracer`. By default,
the currently active `Span` is set as the new `Span`'s parent. The `Tracer`
MAY provide other default options for newly created `Span`s.

`Span` creation MUST NOT set the newly created `Span` as the currently
active `Span` by default, but this functionality MAY be offered additionally
as a separate operation.

The API MUST accept the following parameters:

- The operation name. This is a required parameter.
- The parent Span or parent Span context, and whether the new `Span` should be a
  root `Span`. API MAY also have an option for implicit parent context
  extraction from the current context as a default behavior.
- [`SpanKind`](#spankind), default to `SpanKind.Internal` if not specified.
- `Attribute`s - similar API with [Span::SetAttributes](#set-attributes). These
  attributes will be used to make a sampling decision as noted in [sampling
  description](sdk-tracing.md#sampling). Empty list will be assumed if not
  specified.
- `Link`s - see API definition [here](#add-links). Empty list will be assumed if
  not specified.
- `Start timestamp`, default to current time. This argument SHOULD only be set
  when span creation time has already passed. If API is called at a moment of
  a Span logical start, API user MUST not explicitly set this argument.

Each span has zero or one parent span and zero or more child spans, which
represent causally related operations. A tree of related spans comprises a
trace. A span is said to be a _root span_ if it does not have a parent. Each
trace includes a single root span, which is the shared ancestor of all other
spans in the trace. Implementations MUST provide an option to create a `Span` as
a root span, and MUST generate a new `TraceId` for each root span created.
For a Span with a parent, the `TraceId` MUST be the same as the parent.
Also, the child span MUST inherit all `TraceState` values of its parent by default.

A `Span` is said to have a _remote parent_ if it is the child of a `Span`
created in another process. Each propagators' deserialization must set
`IsRemote` to true on a parent `SpanContext` so `Span` creation knows if the
parent is remote.

#### Add Links

During the `Span` creation user MUST have the ability to record links to other `Span`s. Linked
`Span`s can be from the same or a different trace. See [Links
description](overview.md#links-between-spans).

A `Link` is defined by the following properties:

- (Required) `SpanContext` of the `Span` to link to.
- (Optional) One or more `Attribute`.

The `Link` SHOULD be an immutable type.

The Span creation API should provide:

- An API to record a single `Link` where the `Link` properties are passed as
  arguments. This MAY be called `AddLink`.
- An API to record a single `Link` whose attributes or attribute values are
  lazily constructed, with the intention of avoiding unnecessary work if a link
  is unused. If the language supports overloads then this SHOULD be called
  `AddLink` otherwise `AddLazyLink` MAY be considered. In some languages, it might
  be easier to defer `Link` or attribute creation entirely by providing a wrapping
  class or function that returns a `Link` or formatted attributes. When providing
  a wrapping class or function it SHOULD be named `LinkFormatter`.

Links SHOULD preserve the order in which they're set.

### Span operations

With the exception of the method to retrieve the `Span`'s `SpanContext` and
recording status, none of the below may be called after the `Span` is finished.

#### Get Context

The Span interface MUST provide:

- An API that returns the `SpanContext` for the given `Span`. The returned value
  may be used even after the `Span` is finished. The returned value MUST be the
  same for the entire Span lifetime. This MAY be called `GetContext`.

#### IsRecording

Returns true if this `Span` is recording information like events with the
`AddEvent` operation, attributes using `SetAttributes`, status with `SetStatus`,
etc.

There should be no parameter.

This flag SHOULD be used to avoid expensive computations of a Span attributes or
events in case when a Span is definitely not recorded. Note that any child
span's recording is determined independently from the value of this flag
(typically based on the `sampled` flag of a `TraceFlag` on
[SpanContext](#spancontext)).

This flag may be `true` despite the entire trace being sampled out. This
allows to record and process information about the individual Span without
sending it to the backend. An example of this scenario may be recording and
processing of all incoming requests for the processing and building of
SLA/SLO latency charts while sending only a subset - sampled spans - to the
backend. See also the [sampling section of SDK design](sdk-tracing.md#sampling).

Users of the API should only access the `IsRecording` property when
instrumenting code and never access `SampledFlag` unless used in context
propagators.

#### Set Attributes

A `Span` MUST have the ability to set attributes associated with it.

An `Attribute` is defined by the following properties:

- (Required) The attribute key, which must be a string.
- (Required) The attribute value, which must be either a string, a boolean
  value, or a numeric type.

The Span interface MUST provide:

- An API to set a single `Attribute` where the attribute properties are passed
  as arguments. This MAY be called `SetAttribute`. To avoid extra allocations some
  implementations may offer a separate API for each of the possible value types.

Attributes SHOULD preserve the order in which they're set. Setting an attribute
with the same key as an existing attribute SHOULD overwrite the existing
attribute's value.

Note that the OpenTelemetry project documents certain ["standard
attributes"](data-semantic-conventions.md) that have prescribed semantic meanings.

#### Add Events

A `Span` MUST have the ability to add events. Events have a time associated
with the moment when they are added to the `Span`.

An `Event` is defined by the following properties:

- (Required) Name of the event.
- (Optional) One or more `Attribute`.
- (Optional) Timestamp for the event.

The `Event` SHOULD be an immutable type.

The Span interface MUST provide:

- An API to record a single `Event` where the `Event` properties are passed as
  arguments. This MAY be called `AddEvent`.
- An API to record a single `Event` whose attributes or attribute values are
  lazily constructed, with the intention of avoiding unnecessary work if an event
  is unused. If the language supports overloads then this SHOULD be called
  `AddEvent` otherwise `AddLazyEvent` MAY be considered. In some languages, it
  might be easier to defer `Event` or attribute creation entirely by providing a
  wrapping class or function that returns an `Event` or formatted attributes. When
  providing a wrapping class or function it SHOULD be named `EventFormatter`.

Events SHOULD preserve the order in which they're set. This will typically match
the ordering of the events' timestamps.

Note that the OpenTelemetry project documents certain ["standard event names and
keys"](data-semantic-conventions.md) which have prescribed semantic meanings.

#### Set Status

Sets the [`Status`](#status) of the `Span`. If used, this will override the
default `Span` status, which is `OK`.

Only the value of the last call will be recorded, and implementations are free
to ignore previous calls.

The Span interface MUST provide:

- An API to set the `Status` where the new status is the only argument. This
  SHOULD be called `SetStatus`.

#### UpdateName

Updates the `Span` name. Upon this update, any sampling behavior based on `Span`
name will depend on the implementation.

It is highly discouraged to update the name of a `Span` after its creation.
`Span` name is often used to group, filter and identify the logical groups of
spans. And often, filtering logic will be implemented before the `Span` creation
for performance reasons. Thus the name update may interfere with this logic.

The method name is called `UpdateName` to differentiate this method from the
regular property setter. It emphasizes that this operation signifies a
major change for a `Span` and may lead to re-calculation of sampling or
filtering decisions made previously depending on the implementation.

Alternatives for the name update may be late `Span` creation, when Span is
started with the explicit timestamp from the past at the moment where the final
`Span` name is known, or reporting a `Span` with the desired name as a child
`Span`.

Required parameters:

- The new **operation name**, which supersedes whatever was passed in when the
  `Span` was started

#### End

Finish the `Span`. This call will take the current timestamp to set as `Span`'s
end time. Implementations MUST ignore all subsequent calls to `End` (there might
be exceptions when Tracer is streaming event and has no mutable state associated
with the `Span`).

Call to `End` of a `Span` MUST not have any effects on child spans. Those may
still be running and can be ended later.

Parameters:

- (Optional) Timestamp to explicitly set the end timestamp

This API MUST be non-blocking.

### Span lifetime

Span lifetime represents the process of recording the start and the end
timestamps to the Span object:

- The start time is recorded when the Span is created.
- The end time needs to be recorded when the operation is ended.

Start and end time as well as Event's timestamps MUST be recorded at a time of a
calling of corresponding API.

## Status

`Status` interface represents the status of a finished `Span`. It's composed of
a canonical code in conjunction with an optional descriptive message.

### StatusCanonicalCode

`StatusCanonicalCode` represents the canonical set of status codes of a finished
`Span`, following the [Standard GRPC
codes](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md):

- `Ok`
  - The operation completed successfully.
- `Cancelled`
  - The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller).
- `UnknownError`
  - An unknown error.
- `InvalidArgument`
  - Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from
    `FailedPrecondition`. `InvalidArgument` indicates arguments that are problematic
    regardless of the state of the system.
- `DeadlineExceeded`
  - Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the
    state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has
    completed successfully.
- `NotFound`
  - Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.
- `AlreadyExists`
  - Some entity that we attempted to create (e.g., file or directory) already exists.
- `PermissionDenied`
  - The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
    `PermissionDenied` must not be used if the caller cannot be identified (use
    `Unauthenticated1` instead for those errors).
- `ResourceExhausted`
  - Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the
    entire file system is out of space.
- `FailedPrecondition`
  - Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the
    operation's execution.
- `Aborted`
  - The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like sequencer
    check failures, transaction aborts, etc.
- `OutOfRange`
  - Operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end
    of file. Unlike `InvalidArgument`, this error indicates a problem that may be
    fixed if the system state changes.
- `Unimplemented`
  - Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service.
- `InternalError`
  - Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been
    broken.
- `Unavailable`
  - The service is currently unavailable. This is a most likely a transient
    condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.
- `DataLoss`
  - Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
- `Unauthenticated`
  - The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation.

### Status creation

API MUST provide a way to create a new `Status`.

Required parameters

- `StatusCanonicalCode` of this `Status`.

Optional parameters

- Description of this `Status`.

### GetCanonicalCode

Returns the `StatusCanonicalCode` of this `Status`.

### GetDescription

Returns the description of this `Status`.
Languages should follow their usual conventions on whether to return `null` or an empty string here if no description was given.

### GetIsOk

Returns true if the canonical code of this `Status` is `Ok`, otherwise false.

## SpanKind

`SpanKind` describes the relationship between the Span, its parents,
and its children in a Trace.  `SpanKind` describes two independent
properties that benefit tracing systems during analysis.

The first property described by `SpanKind` reflects whether the Span
is a remote child or parent.  Spans with a remote parent are
interesting because they are sources of external load.  Spans with a
remote child are interesting because they reflect a non-local system
dependency.

The second property described by `SpanKind` reflects whether a child
Span represents a synchronous call.  When a child span is synchronous,
the parent is expected to wait for it to complete under ordinary
circumstances.  It can be useful for tracing systems to know this
property, since synchronous Spans may contribute to the overall trace
latency.

In order for `SpanKind` to be meaningful, callers should arrange that
a single Span does not serve more than one purpose.  For example, a
server-side span should not be used directly as the parent of another
remote span.  As a simple guideline, instrumentation should create a
new Span prior to extracting and serializing the span context for a
remote call.

These are the possible SpanKinds:

* `SERVER` Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of a
  synchronous RPC or other remote request.  This span is the child of
  a remote `CLIENT` span that was expected to wait for a response.
* `CLIENT` Indicates that the span describes a synchronous request to
  some remote service.  This span is the parent of a remote `SERVER`
  span and waits for its response.
* `PRODUCER` Indicates that the span describes the parent of an
  asynchronous request.  This parent span is expected to end before
  the corresponding child `CONSUMER` span, possibly even before the
  child span starts.
* `CONSUMER` Indicates that the span describes the child of an
  asynchronous remote `PRODUCER` request.
* `INTERNAL` Default value. Indicates that the span represents an
  internal operation within an application, as opposed to an
  operations with remote parents or children.

To summarize the interpretation of these kinds:

| `SpanKind` | Synchronous | Asynchronous | Remote Incoming | Remote Outgoing |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `CLIENT` | yes | | | yes |
| `SERVER` | yes | | yes | |
| `PRODUCER` | | yes | | yes|
| `CONSUMER` | | yes | yes | |
| `INTERNAL` | | | | |
