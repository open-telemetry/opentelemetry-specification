# Summary
An `Entry` is used to label anything that is associated
with a specific operation, such as an HTTP request.

# Entry
An `Entry` consists of EntryMetadata, EntryKey, and EntryValue.

## EntryKey

`EntryKey` is the name of the Entry. `EntryKey` along with `EntryValue` can be used to 
aggregate and group stats, annotate traces and logs, etc.

**Restrictions**
- Must contain only printable ASCII (codes between 32 and 126 inclusive)
- Must have length greater than zero and less than 256.
- Must not be empty.

### Create

Creates a new `EntryKey` with the given name in string. This is a static method.

Required parameter:

Name of the `EntryKey`.

### GetName

Returns the name of the `EntryKey`.

## EntryValue

`EntryValue` is a string. It MUST contain only printable ASCII (codes between
32 and 126)

### Create

Creates a new `EntryValue` with the given value in string. This is a static method.

Required parameter:

String value of the `EntryValue`.

### AsString

Returns the string value of the `EntryValue`.

## EntryMetadata

`EntryMetadata` contains properties associated with an `Entry`. For now only the property `EntryTTL`
is defined. In future, additional properties may be added to address specific situations.

The creator of entries determines metadata of an entry it creates.

### Create

Creates a new `EntryMetadata` with the `EntryTTL`. This is a static method.

Required parameter:

`EntryTTL` that represents number of hops an entry can propagate.

### GetEntryTTL

Returns the `EntryTTL`.

### EntryTTL

`EntryTTL` is an integer that represents number of hops an entry can propagate. Anytime a sender serializes an entry,
sends it over the wire and receiver unserializes the entry then the entry is considered to have travelled one hop. 
There could be one or more proxy(ies) between sender and receiver. Proxies are treated as transparent
entities and they may not create additional hops. Every propagation implementation should support an option 
`decrementTTL` (default set to true) that allows proxies to set it to false.

**For now, ONLY special values (0 and -1) are supported.**

#### Special Values
- **NO_PROPAGATION (0)**: An `Entry` with `EntryTTL` value of zero is considered to have local scope and
 is used within the process it created.

- **UNLIMITED_PROPAGATION (-1)**: An `Entry` with `EntryTTL` value of -1 can propagate unlimited hops.
 `EntryTTL` value of -1 is typical used to represent a request, processing of which may span multiple entities.

#### Example for EntryTTL > 0
On a server side typically there is no information about the caller besides ip/port,
but in every process there is a notion of "service_name" entry that is added as a "caller" entry before
serialization when a RPC/HTTP call is made. For the "caller" entry, desirable `EntryTTL` value is 1.

Note that `EntryTTL` value of 1 is not supported at this time. The example is listed here simply to
show a possible use case for `EntryTTL` > 0.
 
### Processing at Receiver and Sender
For now, limited processing is required on Sender and Receiver. However, for the sake of
completeness, future processing requirement is also listed here. These requirements are marked with 
"**(future)**".

This processing is done as part of entry propagator.

#### At Receiver
Upon receiving an entry from remote entity an entry extractor

- MUST decrement the value of `EntryTTL` by one if it is greater than zero. **(future)**
- MUST treat the value of `EntryTTL` as -1 if it is not present.
- MUST discard the `Entry` for any other value of `EntryTTL`. **(future)**

#### At Sender
Upon preparing to send an entry to a remote entity an entry injector
- MUST send the entry AND include `EntryTTL` if its value is greater than 0. **(future)**
- MUST send the entry without `EntryTTL` if its value is -1. Absence of `EntryTTL` on the wire is treated as having `EntryTTL` of -1.
  This is to optimize on-the-wire representation of common case.
- MUST not send the entry if the value of `EntryTTL` is 0.

## Entry Conflict Resolution
If a new entry conflicts with an existing entry then the new entry takes precedence. Entire `Entry` along 
with `EntryValue` and `EntryMetadata` is replaced by the most recent entry (regardless of it is locally
generated or received from a remote peer). Replacement is limited to a scope in which the 
conflict arises. When the scope is closed the original value and metadata prior to the conflict is restored.
For example,
```
T# - Entry keys
V# - Entry Values
M# - Entry Metadata

Enter Scope 1
   Current Entrys E1=V1/M1, E2=V2/M2
    Enter Scope 2
      Add Entrys E3=V3/M3, E2=v4/M4
      Current Entrys E1=V1/M1, E2=V4/M4, E3=V3/M3 <== Value/Metadata of E2 is replaced by V4/M4.
    Close Scope 2
   Current Entrys E1=V1/M1, E2=V2/M2  <== E2 is restored.
Close Scope 1
```
