# Glossary

Below are a list of some OpenTelemetry specific terms that are used across this
specification.

## (Telemetry) Library

Denotes the actual *OpenTelemetry* (or API-compatible) library in use.  
See [Library resource semantic conventions](data-resource-semantic-conventions.md#library)

<a name="instrumented_library"></a>

## Instrumented Library

Denotes the library that is monitored, i.e. the library of interest that signals (traces, metrics, logs) are emitted for.

The actual OpenTelemetry API calls can happen inside this library but might as well
happen in a different one (the [Instrumenting Library](#instrumenting_library)).

Example: `org.mongodb.client`.

<a name="instrumenting_library"></a>

## Instrumenting Library

Denotes the library which provides the instrumentation *for* a given library
(i.e. *for* the [Instrumented Library](#instrumented_library)). Hence,
*Instrumented Library* and *Instrumenting Library* can be identical if a library
has built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation, but they don't necessarily have to.

Example: `io.opentelemetry.contrib.mongodb`.

Synonyms: *Instrumentation Library*, *Integration*.

<a name="name"></a>

## Tracer Name / Meter Name

This refers to the `name` and (optional) `version` arguments specified when
creating a new `Tracer` or `Meter` (see [Obtaining a Tracer](api-tracing.md#obtaining-a-tracer)/[Obtaining a Meter](api-metrics-user.md#obtaining-a-meter)). It identifies the [Instrumenting Library](#instrumenting_library).

## Namespace

This term applies to [Metric names](api-metrics-user.md#metric-names) only. The namespace is used to disambiguate identical metric
names used in different [instrumenting libraries](#instrumenting_library). The [Name](#name) provided
for creating a `Meter` serves as its namespace in addition to the primary semantics
described [here](#name).

The `version` argument is not relevant here and will not be included in
the resulting namespace string.
