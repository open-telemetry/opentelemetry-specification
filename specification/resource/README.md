## Overview

A Resource is an immutable representation of the entity producing telemetry.
Within OpenTelemetry, all signals are associated with a Resource, enabling
contextual correlation of data from the same source.  For Example, if I see
a high latency in a span I should be able to check the metrics for the
same entity that produced that Span during the time when the latency was
observed.
