# GCP Semantic Conventions

**NOTICE** Semantic Conventions are moving to a
[new location](http://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions).

No changes to this document are allowed.

This directory defines standards for resource attributes that only apply to
Google Cloud Platform (GCP). If an attribute could apply to resources from more than one cloud
provider (like account ID, operating system, etc), it belongs in the parent
`semantic_conventions` directory.
