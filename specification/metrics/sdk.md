language client maintainers, we don't recommend OpenTelemetry clients to start
the implementation unless explicitly communicated via

## MeterProvider

TODO:

* Allow multiple pipelines (processors, exporters).
* Configure "Views".
* Configure timing (related to [issue
  1432](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/1432)).

## MeasurementProcessor

`MeasurementProcessor` is an interface which allows hooks when a
[Measurement](./api.md#measurement) is recorded by an
[Instrument](./api.md#instrument).

`MeasurementProcessor` MUST have access to:

* The `Measurement`
* The `Instrument`, which is used to report the `Measurement`
* The `Resource`, which is associated with the `MeterProvider`

In addition to things listed above, if the `Measurement` is reported by a
synchronous `Instrument` (e.g. [Counter](./api.md#counter)),
`MeasurementProcessor` MUST have access to:

* [Baggage](../baggage/api.md)
* [Context](../context/context.md)
* The [Span](../trace/api.md#span) which is associated with the `Measurement`

Depending on the programming language and runtime model, these can be provided
explicitly (e.g. as input arguments) or implicitly (e.g. [implicit
Context](../context/context.md#optional-global-operations) and the [currently
active span](../trace/api.md#context-interaction)).

### Aggregator

An `Aggregator` is a type of `MeasurementProcessor` and computes "aggregate"
data from [Measurements](./api.md#measurement) and its `In-Memory State` into
[Pre-Aggregated Metric](./datamodel.md#timeseries-model).

```text

                 +---------------------+
                 | Aggregator          |
                 |                     |
 [Measurements]------> "Aggregate"     |
                 |         |           |
                 | +-------V---------+ |
                 | |                 | |
                 | | In-Memory State | |
                 | |                 | |
                 | +-------+---------+ |
                 |         |           |
                 |         V           |
                 |      "Collect" +------[Pre-Aggregated Metrics]-->
                 |                     |
                 +---------------------+
```

An `Aggregator` MUST provide an interface to "aggregate" [Measurement](./api.md#measurement)
data into its `In-Memory State`.

An `Aggregator` MUST provide an interface to "collect" [Pre-Aggregated Metric](./datamodel.md#timeseries-model)
data from its `In-Memory State`. The collect call should be treated as a
stateful action and may reset in-memory state data. e.g. Resetting the time window
for delta temporality instruments.

An `Aggregator` MUST have read/write access to memory storage (`In-Memory
State`) where it can store/retreive/manage its own internal state.

Note: SDK SHOULD provide configuration and control for memory availability to
optimize usage. Aggregators MUST log errors when memory limits are reached
and/or data lost occurs due to memory mitigation strategy. (e.g dropping high
cardinality attributes).

An `Aggregator` MUST have access to or given the [View](./sdk.md#view)
configuration so it can be properly configure. e.g. Configure a Sum aggregator
for Monoticity and Temporality.

SDK MUST route measurements to the configured aggregator/s. e.g. SDK
expand a measurement's Attributes to key/value pair combinations, and route
measurements for each distinct key/value pair combinations to zero or more
aggregator/s.

SDK MUST provide aggregators to support the default configured aggregator
per instrument kind. e.g. Counter instruments default to a "Sum" aggregator
configured for monotonic values.

### Last Value Aggregator

The Last Value Aggregator collect data for the [Gauge Metric Point](./datamodel.md#gauge)
and is default aggregator for the following instruments.

* [Asynchronous Gauge](./api.md#asynchronous-gauge) instrument.

Last Value Aggregator maintains the following in memory:

* Last Value (latest Measurement given, avoid any time comparison.)

### Sum Aggregator

The Sum Aggregator collect data for the [Sum Metric Point](./datamodel.md#sums)
and is default aggregator for the following instruments.

* [Counter](./api.md#counter) instruments.
* [UpDown Counter](./api.md#updown-counter) instruments.
* [Asynchronous Counter](./api.md#asynchronous-counter) instruments.
* [Asynchronous UpDown Counter](./api.md#asynchronous-updown-counter) instruments.

The Sum Aggregator MUST be configurable to support different Monoticity and/or
Temporality.

Sum Aggregator maintains the following in memory:

* Time window (e.g. start time, end time)
* Sum (sum of Measurements per Monoticity and Temporality configuration.)

### Histogram Aggregator

The Histogram Aggregator collect data for the [Histogram Metric Point](./datamodel.md#histogram)
and is default aggregator for the following instruments.

* [Histogram](./api.md#histogram) instruments.

The Histogram Aggregator MUST be configurable to support different Temporality.

Histogram Aggregator maintains the following in memory:

* Time window (e.g. start time, end time)
* Count
* Sum
* Bucket Counts (per configured boundaries)

### An example of SDK implementation

SDK expand each Measurement's Attribute by the combination of key/value pairs.
For each distinct combination, SDK will route to an instance of a configured
aggregator.

## MetricProcessor

`MetricProcessor` is an interface which allows hooks for [pre-aggregated metrics
data](./datamodel.md#timeseries-model).

Built-in metric processors are responsible for batching and conversion of
metrics data to exportable representation and passing batches to exporters.

The following diagram shows `MetricProcessor`'s relationship to other components
in the SDK:

```text
+-----------------+            +-----------------+            +-----------------------+
|                 | Metrics... |                 | Metrics... |                       |
> In-memory state | -----------> MetricProcessor | -----------> MetricExporter (push) |--> Another process
|                 |            |                 |            |                       |

|                 |            |                 |            |                       |
+-----------------+            +-----------------+            +-----------------------+
```

## MetricExporter

`MetricExporter` defines the interface that protocol-specific exporters must
implement so that they can be plugged into OpenTelemetry SDK and support sending
of telemetry data.

The goal of the interface is to minimize burden of implementation for
protocol-dependent telemetry exporters. The protocol exporter is expected to be
primarily a simple telemetry data encoder and transmitter.

Metric Exporter has access to the [pre-aggregated metrics
data](./datamodel.md#timeseries-model).

There could be multiple [Push Metric Exporters](#push-metric-exporter) or [Pull
Metric Exporters](#pull-metric-exporter) or even a mixture of both configured on
a given `MeterProvider`. Different exporters can run at different schedule, for
example:

* Exporter A is a push exporter which sends data every 1 minute.
* Exporter B is a push exporter which sends data every 5 seconds.
* Exporter C is a pull exporter which reacts to a scraper over HTTP.
* Exporter D is a pull exporter which reacts to another scraper over a named
  pipe.

### Push Metric Exporter

Push Metric Exporter sends the data on its own schedule. Here are some examples:

* Sends the data based on a user configured schedule, e.g. every 1 minute.
* Sends the data when there is a severe error.

### Pull Metric Exporter

Pull Metric Exporter reacts to the metrics scrapers and reports the data
passively. This pattern has been widely adopted by
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
