Note: this specification is subject to major changes. To avoid thrusting
language client maintainers, we don't recommend OpenTelemetry clients to start
the implementation unless explicitly communicated via
[OTEP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps#opentelemetry-enhancement-proposal-otep).

## MeterProvider

TODO:

* Allow multiple pipelines (processors, exporters).
* Configure "Views".
* Configure timing (related to [issue
  1432](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/1432)).

## MeasurementProcessor

`MeasurementProcessor` is an interface which allows hooks when a
[Measurement](./api.md#measurement) is recorded by an
[Instrument](./api.md#instrument).

`MeasurementProcessor` MUST have access to:

* The `Measurement`
* The `Instrument`, which is used to report the `Measurement`
* The `Resource`, which is associated with the `MeterProvider`

In addition to things listed above, if the `Measurement` is reported by a
synchronous `Instrument` (e.g. [Counter](./api.md#counter)),
`MeasurementProcessor` MUST have access to:

* [Baggage](../baggage/api.md)
* [Context](../context/context.md)
* The [Span](../trace/api.md#span) which is associated with the `Measurement`

Depending on the programming language and runtime model, these can be provided
explicitly (e.g. as input arguments) or implicitly (e.g. [implicit
Context](../context/context.md#optional-global-operations) and the [currently
active span](../trace/api.md#context-interaction)).

```

## MetricProcessor

`MetricProcessor` is an interface which allows hooks for [pre-aggregated metrics
data](./datamodel.md#timeseries-model).

Built-in metric processors are responsible for batching and conversion of
metrics data to exportable representation and passing batches to exporters.

The following diagram shows `MetricProcessor`'s relationship to other components
in the SDK:

> In-memory state | -----------> MetricProcessor | -----------> MetricExporter (push) |--> Another process
|                 |            |                 |            |                       |

> In-memory state |------------> MetricProcessor |------------> MetricExporter (pull) |--> Another process (scraper)
|                 |            |                 |            |                       |
+-----------------+            +-----------------+            +-----------------------+
```

## MetricExporter

`MetricExporter` defines the interface that protocol-specific exporters must
implement so that they can be plugged into OpenTelemetry SDK and support sending
of telemetry data.

The goal of the interface is to minimize burden of implementation for
protocol-dependent telemetry exporters. The protocol exporter is expected to be
primarily a simple telemetry data encoder and transmitter.

Metric Exporter has access to the [pre-aggregated metrics
data](./datamodel.md#timeseries-model).

There could be multiple [Push Metric Exporters](#push-metric-exporter) or [Pull
Metric Exporters](#pull-metric-exporter) or even a mixture of both configured on
a given `MeterProvider`. Different exporters can run at different schedule, for
example:

* Exporter A is a push exporter which sends data every 1 minute.
* Exporter B is a push exporter which sends data every 5 seconds.
* Exporter C is a pull exporter which reacts to a scraper over HTTP.
* Exporter D is a pull exporter which reacts to another scraper over a named
  pipe.

### Push Metric Exporter

Push Metric Exporter sends the data on its own schedule. Here are some examples:

* Sends the data based on a user configured schedule, e.g. every 1 minute.
* Sends the data when there is a severe error.

### Pull Metric Exporter

Pull Metric Exporter reacts to the metrics scrapers and reports the data
passively. This pattern has been widely adopted by
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
