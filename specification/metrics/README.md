Note: this specification is subject to major changes. To avoid thrusting
language client maintainers, we don't recommend OpenTelemetry clients to start
the implementation unless explicitly communicated via
[OTEP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps#opentelemetry-enhancement-proposal-otep).

## Overview

### Design Goals

Given there are many well-established metrics solutions that exist today, it is
important to understand the goals of OpenTelemetryâ€™s metrics effort:

* **Being able to connect metrics to other signals**. For example, metrics and
  traces can be correlated via exemplars, and metrics dimensions can be enriched
  via [Baggage](../baggage/api.md) and [Context](../context/context.md).
  Additionally, [Resource](../resource/sdk.md) can be applied to
  [logs](../overview.md#log-signal)/[metrics](../overview.md#metric-signal)/[traces](../overview.md#tracing-signal)
  in a consistent way.

* **Providing a path for [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) customers to
  migrate to OpenTelemetry**. This was the original goal of OpenTelemetry -
  converging OpenCensus and OpenTracing. We will focus on providing the
  semantics and capability, instead of doing a 1-1 mapping of the APIs.

* **Working with existing metrics instrumentation protocols and standards**. The
  minimum goal is to provide full support for
  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and
  [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) - users should be able to use
  OpenTelemetry clients and [Collector](../overview.md#collector) to collect and
  export metrics, with the ability to achieve the same functionality as their
  native clients.

### Concepts

#### API

The **OpenTelemetry Metrics API** ("the API" hereafter) serves two purposes:

* Capturing raw measurements efficiently and simultaneously.
* Decoupling the instrumentation from the [SDK](#sdk), allowing the SDK to be
  specified/included in the application.

When no [SDK](#sdk) is explicitly included/enabled in the application, no telemetry data
will be collected. Please refer to the overall [OpenTelemetry
API](../overview.md#api) concept and [API and Minimal
Implementation](../library-guidelines.md#api-and-minimal-implementation) for
more information.

#### SDK

The **OpenTelemetry Metrics SDK** ("the SDK" hereafter) implements the API,
providing functionality and extensibility such as configuration, aggregation,
processors and exporters.

OpenTelemetry requires a [separation of the API from the
SDK](../library-guidelines.md#requirements), so that different SDKs can be
configured at run time. Please refer to the overall [OpenTelemetry
SDK](../overview.md#sdk) concept concept for more information.

#### Programming Model
