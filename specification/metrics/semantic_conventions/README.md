# Metrics Semantic Conventions

The following semantic conventions surrounding metrics are defined:

* [HTTP Metrics](http-metrics.md): Semantic conventions and instruments for HTTP metrics.
* [System Metrics](system-metrics.md): Semantic conventions and instruments for standard system metrics.
* [Process Metrics](process-metrics.md): Semantic conventions and instruments for standard process metrics.
* [Runtime Metrics](runtime-metrics.md): Semantic conventions and instruments for runtime metrics.

Apart from semantic conventions for metrics and [traces](../../trace/semantic_conventions/README.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](../../resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](../../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md).
