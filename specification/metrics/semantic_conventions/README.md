# Metrics Semantic Conventions

TODO: Add semantic conventions for metric names and labels.

Apart from semantic conventions for metrics and [traces](../../trace/semantic_conventions/README.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](../../resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](../../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md).
