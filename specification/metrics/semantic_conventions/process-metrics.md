# Semantic Conventions for OS Process Metrics

**Status**: [Experimental](../../document-status.md)

This document describes instruments and attributes for common OS process level
metrics in OpenTelemetry. Also consider the [general metric semantic
conventions](README.md#general-metric-semantic-conventions) when creating
instruments not explicitly defined in this document. OS process metrics are
not related to the runtime environment of the program, and should take
measurements from the operating system. For runtime environment metrics see
[semantic conventions for runtime environment
metrics](runtime-environment-metrics.md).

## Metric Instruments

### Process

Below is a table of Process metric instruments.

| Name                              | Instrument Type ([*](README.md#instrument-types)) | Units | Description                                                                                                                         | Labels                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Attributes

Process metrics SHOULD be associated with a [`process`](../../resource/semantic_conventions/process.md#process) resource whose attributes provide additional context about the process.
