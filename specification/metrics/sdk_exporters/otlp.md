# OpenTelemetry Metrics Exporter - OTLP

**Status**: [Experimental](../../document-status.md)

OTLP Metrics Exporter is a [Push Metric
Exporter](../sdk.md#push-metric-exporter) which sends metrics via the
[OpenTelemetry Protocol](../../protocol/README.md).

OTLP Metrics Exporter MUST support both Cumulative and Delta
[Temporality](../datamodel.md#temporality).

OTLP Metrics Exporter MUST allow [Aggregation
Temporality](../datamodel.md#temporality) to be specified, as described in
[MetricExporter](../sdk.md#metricexporter).

If the temporality is not specified, OTLP Metrics Exporter SHOULD use Cumulative
as the default temporality.
