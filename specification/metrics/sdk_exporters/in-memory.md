# OpenTelemetry Metrics Exporter - In-memory

**Status**: [Experimental](../document-status.md)

Note: this specification is subject to major changes. To avoid thrusting
language client maintainers, we don't recommend OpenTelemetry clients to start
the implementation unless explicitly communicated.
