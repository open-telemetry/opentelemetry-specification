# Logs GA Scope

This document defines what's in scope for OpenTelemetry Logs General
Availability release.

## Motivation

Clearly defined scope is important to align all logs contributors and to make
sure we know what target we are working towards. Note that some of the listed
items are already fully or partially implemented but are still listed for
completeness.

General Availability of OpenTelemetry Logs is expected after OpenTelemetry 1.0
GA (which will only include traces and metrics).

## Logs Roadmap Items

### Specification and SDK

- Write guidelines and specification for logging libraries to support
  OpenTelemetry-compliant logs.

- Implement OpenTelemetry logs SDK for Java that support trace context
  extraction from the current execution context.

- Show full OpenTelemetry-compliant implementation of an "addon" to one of the
  popular logging libraries for Java (e.g. Log4J, SLF4J, etc). Use OpenTelemetry
  SDK to automatically include extracted trace context in the logs and support
  exporting via OTLP.

- Implement an example Java application that shows how to emit correlated traces
  and logs. Use the supported popular logging library together with
  OpenTelemetry SDK, and export logs using OTLP.

- Add Logs support to OTLP specification.

### Collector

- Implement receiver and exporter for OTLP logs in Collector.

- Implement "array" value type for in-memory data structures (it is already part
  of OTLP but is not supported by the Collector yet).

- Implement log exporters in Collector for a few vendor formats from
  participating vendors.

- Implement Fluent Forward protocol receiver to receive logs from
  FluentBit/FluentD.

- Add support for log data type to the following processors: `resource`,
  `batch`, `attributes`, `k8s_tagger`, `resourcedetection`.

- Add end-to-end performance tests for log forwarding (similar to existing trace
  and metric tests) at least for OTLP and Fluent Forward protocols.

- Test operation of Collector together with at least one other logging agent
  (e.g. FluentBit), allowing to read file logs as described here. Publish test
  results (including performance).

- Implement an example that shows how to use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect
  correlated logs, traces and metrics from a distributed microservices
  application (preferably running in a cloud native control plane like
  Kubernetes)
