# A Dynamic Configuration Service for the SDK

This proposal is a request to develop a prototype to configure metric collection periods. Per-metric and tracing configuration is also intended to be added, with details left for a later iteration.

It is related to [this pull request](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/pull/155)

## Motivation

During normal use, users may wish to collect metrics every 10 minutes. Later, while investigating a production issue, the same user could easily increase information available for debugging by reconfiguring some of their processes to collect metrics every 30 seconds. Because this change is centralized and does not require redeploying with new configurations, there is lower friction and risk in updating the configurations.

## Explanation

This OTEP is a proposal for an experimental feature [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification#62](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/632), to be developed as a proof of concept. This means no development will be done inside either the OpenTelemetry SDK or the collector. Since this will be implemented in [opentelemetry-go-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib) and [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib), all of this functionality will be optional.

The user, when instrumenting their application, can configure the SDK with the endpoint of their remote configuration service, the associated Resource, and a default config to be used if it fails to read from the configuration service.

The user must then set up the config service. This can be done through the collector, which can be set up to expose an arbitrary configuration service implementation. Depending on implementation, this allows the collector to either act as a stand-alone configuration service, or as a bridge to remote configurations of the user's monitoring backend by 'translating' the monitoring backend's protocol to comply with the OpenTelemetry configuration protocol.

## Internal details

In the future, we intend to add per-metric configuration. For example, this would allow the user to collect 5xx server error counts ever minute, and CPU usage statistics every 10 minutes. The remote configuration protocol was designed with this in mind, meaning that it includes more details than simply the metric collection period.

Our remote configuration protocol will support this call:

```
service MetricConfig {
  rpc GetMetricConfig (MetricConfigRequest) returns (MetricConfigResponse);
}
```

A request to the config service will look like this:

```
message MetricConfigRequest{

  // Required. The resource for which configuration should be returned.
  opentelemetry.proto.resource.v1.Resource resource = 1;

  // Optional. The value of ConfigResponse.fingerprint for the last configuration
  // that the caller received and successfully applied.
  bytes last_known_fingerprint = 2;
}
```

While the response will look like this:

```
message MetricConfigResponse {

  // Optional. The fingerprint associated with this MetricConfigResponse. Each
  // change in configs yields a different fingerprint.
  bytes fingerprint = 1;

  // A Schedule is used to apply a particular scheduling configuration to
  // a metric. If a metric name matches a schedule's patterns, then the metric
  // adopts the configuration specified by the schedule.

  message Schedule {

    // A light-weight pattern that can match 1 or more
    // metrics, for which this schedule will apply. The string is used to
    // match against metric names. It should not exceed 100k characters.
    message Pattern {
      oneof match {
        string equals = 1;       // matches the metric name exactly
        string starts_with = 2;  // prefix-matches the metric name
      }
    }

    // Metrics with names that match at least one rule in the inclusion_patterns are
    // targeted by this schedule. Metrics that match at least one rule from the
    // exclusion_patterns are not targeted for this schedule, even if they match an
    // inclusion pattern.

    // For this iteration, since we only want one Schedule that applies to all metrics,
    // we will not check the inclusion_patterns and exclusion_patterns.
    repeated Pattern exclusion_patterns = 1;
    repeated Pattern inclusion_patterns = 2;

    // Describes the collection period for each schedule in seconds.
    int32 period_sec = 3;
  }

  // For this iteration, since we only want one Schedule that applies to all metrics,
  // we will have a restriction that schedules must have a length of 1, and we will
  // not check the patterns when we apply the collection period.
  repeated Schedule schedules = 2;

  // Optional. The client is suggested to wait this long (in seconds) before
  // pinging the configuration service again.
  int32 suggested_wait_time_sec = 3;
}
```

The SDK will periodically read a config from the service using GetConfig. This reading interval can depend on If it fails to do so, it will just use either the default config or the most recent successfully read config. If it reads a new config, it will apply it.

Export frequency from the SDK depends on Schedules. There can only be one Schedule for now, which defines the schedule for all metrics. The schedule has a CollectionPeriod, which defines how often metrics are exported.

In the future, we will add per-metric configuration. Each Schedule also has inclusion_patterns and exclusion_patterns. Any metrics that match any of the inclusion_patterns and do not match any of the exclusion_patterns will be exported every CollectionPeriod (e.g. every minute). A component will be added that can export metrics that match a pattern from one Schedule at that Schedule's collection period, while exporting other metrics that match the patterns of another Schedule at that other Schedule's collection period.

The collector will support a new interface for a DynamicConfig service that can be used by an SDK, allowing a custom implementation of the configuration service protocol described above, to act as an optional bridge between an SDK and an arbitrary configuration service. This interface can be implemented as a shim to support accessing remote configurations from arbitrary backends. The collector is configured to expose an endpoint for requests to the DynamicConfig service, and returns results on that endpoint.

## Trade-offs and mitigations

This feature will be implemented purely as an experiment, to demonstrate its viability and usefulness. More investigation can be done after a rough prototype is demonstrated.

As mentioned [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/pull/155#issuecomment-640582048), the configuration service can be a potential attack vector for an application instrumented with OpenTelemetry, depending on what we allow in the protocol. We can highlight in the remote configuration protocol that for future changes, caution is needed in terms of the sorts of configurations we allow.

Having a small polling interval (how often we read configs) would mean that config changes could be applied very quickly. However, this would also increase load on the configuration service. The typical use case probably does not need config changes to be applied immediately and config changes will likely be quite infrequent, so a typical polling interval probably needs to be no more frequent than every several minutes.

## Prior art and alternatives

Jaegar has the option of a Remote sampler, which allows reading from a central configuration, even dynamically with an Adaptive sampler.

The main comparative for remote configuration is a push vs. polling mechanism. The benefits of having a mechanism where the configuration service pushes new configs is that it's less work for the user, with it being not necessary for them to set up a configuration service. There is also no load associated with polling the configuration service in the instrumented application, which would keep the OpenTelemetry SDK more lightweight.

Using a polling mechanism may be more performant in the context of large distributed applications with many instrumented processes. This is a result of having the instrumented processes polling the configuration service, rather than the config service having to push to processes. A polling mechanism is also compatible with more network protocols, not just gRPC.

## Open questions

- As mentioned [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/pull/155#issuecomment-640582048). what happens if a malicious/accidental config change overwhelms the application/monitoring system? Is it the responsibility of the user to be cautious while making config changes? Should we automatically decrease telemetry exporting if we can detect performance problems?

## Future possibilities

If this OTEP is implemented, there is the option to remotely and dynamically configure other things. As mentioned [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/pull/155#issuecomment-639878490), possibilities include labels and aggregations. As mentioned [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/pull/121#discussion_r447839301), it is also possible to configure the collector.

It is intended to add per-metric configuration and well as tracing configuration in the future.
