This OTEP provides guidance on how to record errors using OpenTelemetry Logs
focusing on minimizing duplication and providing context to reduce the noise.

In the long term, errors recorded on logs **will replace span events**
(according to [Event vision OTEP](./0265-event-vision.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> Throughout this OTEP, the terms exception and error are defined as follows:
>
> - *Error* refers to a general concept describing any non-success condition,
>   which may manifest as an exception, non-successful status code, or an invalid
>   response.
> - *Exception* specifically refers to runtime exceptions and their associated stack traces.

## Motivation

Today OTel supports recording *exceptions* using span events available through Trace API. Outside of OTel world,
*errors* are usually recorded by user apps and libraries using logging libraries
and may be recorded as OTel logs via logging bridge.

Errors recorded on logs have the following advantages over span events:

- they can be recorded for operations that don't have any tracing instrumentation
- they can be sampled along with or separately from spans
- they can have different severity levels to reflect how critical the error is
- they are already reported natively by many frameworks and libraries

Recording errors is essential for troubleshooting, but regardless of how they are recorded, they could be noisy:

- distributed applications experience transient errors at the rate proportional to their scale and
  errors in logs could be misleading - individual occurrence of transient errors
  are not necessarily indicative of a problem.
- exception stack traces can be huge. Corresponding attribute value can frequently reach several KBs resulting in high costs
  associated with ingesting and storing them. It's also common to log errors multiple times
  as they bubble up leading to duplication and aggravating the verbosity problem.
- severity depends on the context and, in general case, is not known when error
  occurs. Errors are frequently handled (suppressed, retried, ignored) by the caller.

In this OTEP, we'll provide guidance around recording errors that minimizes duplication,
allows reducing noise with configuration, and allows capturing errors in the
absence of a recorded span.

This guidance applies to general-purpose instrumentations including natively
instrumented libraries.

Application developers should consider following it as a starting point, but
they are encouraged to adjust it to their needs.

## Guidance

This guidance boils down to the following:

Instrumentations SHOULD record error information along with relevant context as
a log record with appropriate severity.

Instrumentations SHOULD set severity to `Error` or higher only when log describes a
problem affecting application functionality, availability, performance, security or
another aspect important for this type of applications.

When instrumentation records exception, it SHOULD provide
the whole exception instance to the OTel SDK so the SDK can record it fully or
partially based on provided configuration. The default SDK behavior SHOULD
be to record exception stack traces when logging exceptions at `Error` or higher severity.

### Details

1. Errors SHOULD be recorded on [logs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.29.0/docs/exceptions/exceptions-logs.md)
   or as [log-based events](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.29.0/docs/general/events.md)

2. Instrumentations for incoming requests, message processing, background job execution, or others that wrap application code and usually
   create local root spans, SHOULD record logs for unhandled errors with `Error` severity.

   Some runtimes provide global exception handler that can be used to log exceptions.
   Priority should be given to the instrumentation point where the operation context is available.
   Language SIGs are encouraged to give runtime-specific guidance. For example, here is the
   [.NET guidance](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/610045298873397e55e0df6cd777d4901ace1f63/docs/trace/reporting-exceptions/README.md#unhandled-exception)
   for recording exceptions on traces.

3. Natively instrumented libraries SHOULD record a log describing an error and the context it happened in
   as soon as the error is detected (or where the most context is available).

4. It's NOT RECOMMENDED to record the same error as it propagates through the call stack, or
   to attach the same instance of an exception to multiple log records.

5. An error SHOULD be logged with appropriate severity depending on the available context.

   - Errors that don't indicate actual issues SHOULD be recorded with
     severity not higher than `Info`.

     Such errors can be used to control application logic and have a minor impact, if any,
     on application functionality, availability, or performance (beyond performance hit introduced
     if exception is used to control application logic).

     Examples:

      - error is returned when checking optional dependency or resource existence.
      - exception is thrown on the server when client disconnects before reading
        full response from the server

   - Errors that are expected to be retried or handled by the caller or another
     layer of the component SHOULD be recorded with severity not higher than `Warn`.

     Such errors represent transient failures that are common and expected in
     distributed applications. They typically increase the latency of individual
     operations and have a minor impact on overall application availability.

     Examples:

      - attempt to connect to the required remote dependency times out
      - remote dependency returns 401 "Unauthorized" response code
      - writing data to a file results in IO exception
      - remote dependency returned 503 "Service Unavailable" response for 5 times in a row,
        retry attempts are exhausted and the corresponding operation has failed.

   - Unhandled (by the application code) errors that don't result in application
     shutdown SHOULD be recorded with severity `Error`

     These errors are not expected and may indicate a bug in the application logic
     that this application instance was not able to recover from or a gap in the error
     handling logic.

     Examples:

      - Background job terminates with an exception
      - HTTP framework error handler catches exception thrown by the application code.

        Note: some frameworks use exceptions as a communication mechanism when request fails. For example,
        Spring users can throw [ResponseStatusException](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/server/ResponseStatusException.html)
        exception to return unsuccessful status code. Such exceptions represent errors already handled by the application code.
        Application code, in this case, is expected to log this at appropriate severity.
        General-purpose instrumentation MAY record such errors, but at severity not higher than `Warn`.

   - Errors that result in application shutdown SHOULD be recorded with severity `Fatal`.

      - The application detects an invalid configuration at startup and shuts down.
      - The application encounters a (presumably) terminal error, such as an out-of-memory condition.

6. When recording exceptions on logs, applications and instrumentations are encouraged to add additional attributes
   to describe the context that the exception was thrown in.
   They are also encouraged to define their own error events and enrich them with exception details.

7. OTel SDK SHOULD record stack traces on exceptions with severity `Error` or higher and SHOULD allow users to
   change the threshold.

   See [logback exception config](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ex) for an example of configuration that
   records stack trace conditionally.

8. Instrumentation libraries that record exceptions using span events SHOULD gracefully migrate
   to log-based exceptions offering it as an opt-in feature first and then switching to log-based exceptions
   in the next major version update.

## API changes

> [!NOTE]
>
> It should not be an instrumentation concern to decide whether exception stack trace
> should be recorded or not.
>
> A natively instrumented library may write logs providing exception instance
> through a log bridge and not be aware of this guidance.
>
> It also may be desirable by some vendors/apps to record all exception details at all levels.

OTel Logs API SHOULD provide methods that enrich log record with exception details such as
`setException(exception)` and similar to [RecordException](../specification/trace/api.md#record-exception) method on span.

OTel SDK, based on the log severity and configuration, SHOULD record exception details fully or partially.

The signature of the method is to be determined by each language
and can be overloaded as appropriate including ability to customize stack trace
collection.

It MUST be possible to efficiently set exception information on a log record based on configuration
and without using the `setException` method.

## Examples

### Logging errors from client library in a user application

```java
StorageClient client = createClient(endpoint, credential);
...
try {
    BinaryData content = client.download(contentId);

    return response(content, HttpStatus.OK);
} catch (ContentNotFoundException ex) {
    // we don't record exception here, but may record a log record without exception info
    logger.logRecordBuilder()
        .addAttribute(AttributeKey.stringKey("com.example.content.id"), contentId)
        // let's assume it's expected that some content can disappear
        .severityNumber(Severity.INFO)
        // by default SDK will only populate `exception.type` and `exception.message`
        // since severity is `INFO`, but it should not be instrumentation library
        // concern
        .setException(ex)
        .emit();

    return response(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
} catch (ForbiddenException ex) {
    logger.logRecordBuilder()
        // let's assume it's really unexpected for this application - service does not have access to the underlying storage.
        .severityNumber(Severity.ERROR)
        .addAttribute(AttributeKey.stringKey("com.example.content.id"), contentId)
        // by default SDK will record stack trace for this exception since the severity is ERROR
        .setException(ex)
        .emit();

    return response(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
}
```

### Logging errors inside the natively instrumented Library

It's a common practice to record errors using logging libraries. Client libraries that are natively instrumented with OpenTelemetry should
leverage OTel Events/Logs API for their exception logging purposes.

```java
public class StorageClient {

    private final Logger logger;
    ...
    public BinaryData getContent(String contentId) {
         HttpResponse response = client.get(contentId);
         if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
             return readContent(response);
         }

         logger.logRecordBuilder()
            // In general we don't know if it's an error - we expect caller
            // to handle it and decide. So this is warning (at most).
            // If exception thrown below remains unhandled, it'd be logged by the global handler.
            .setSeverity(Severity.WARN)
            .addAttribute(AttributeKey.stringKey("com.example.content.id"), contentId)
            .addAttribute(AttributeKey.stringKey("http.response.status_code"), response.statusCode())
            .setBody("Unexpected HTTP response")
            .emit();

        if (response.statusCode() == 404) {
            throw new ContentNotFoundException(readErrorInfo(response));
        }

        ...
    }
}
```

Network level errors are part of normal life, we should consider using low severity for them

```java
public class NetworkClient {

    private final Logger logger;
    ...
    public long send(ByteBuffer content) {
        try {
            return socketChannel.write(content);
        } catch (SocketException ex) {
            logger.logRecordBuilder()
              // we'll retry it, so it's info or lower.
              // we'll write a warn for overall operation if retries are exhausted.
              .setSeverity(Severity.INFO)
              .addAttribute("connection.id", this.getId())
              .addException(ex)
              .setBody("Failed to send content")
              .emit();

            throw ex;
        }
    }
}
```

### Logging errors in messaging processor

#### Natively instrumented library

In this example, application code provides the callback to the messaging processor to
execute for each message.

```java
MessagingProcessorClient processorClient = new MessagingClientBuilder()
  .endpoint(endpoint)
  .queueName(queueName)
  .processor()
  .processMessage(messageContext -> processMessage(messageContext))
  .buildProcessorClient();

processorClient.start();
```

The `MessagingProcessorClient` implementation should catch exceptions thrown by the `processMessage` callback and log them similarly to
this example:

```java
MessageContext context = retrieveNext();
try {
  processMessage.accept(context)
} catch (Throwable t) {
  // This natively instrumented library may use OTel log API or another logging library such as slf4j.
  // Here we use Error severity since this exception was not handled by the application code.
  logger.atError()
    .addKeyValuePair("messaging.message.id", context.getMessageId())
    ...
    .setException(t)
    .log("Message processing failed");
  // error handling logic ...
}
```

If this instrumentation supports tracing, it should capture the error in the scope of the processing
span.

#### Instrumentation library

In this example we leverage Spring Kafka `RecordInterceptor` extensibility point that allows to
listen to exceptions that remained unhandled.

```java
import org.springframework.kafka.listener.RecordInterceptor;
final class InstrumentedRecordInterceptor<K, V> implements RecordInterceptor<K, V> {
  ...

  @Override
  public void failure(ConsumerRecord<K, V> record, Exception exception, Consumer<K, V> consumer) {
    // we should capture this error in the scope of the processing span (or pass its context explicitly).
    logger.logRecordBuilder()
      .setSeverity(Severity.ERROR)
      .addAttribute("messaging.message.id", record.getId())
      ...
      .addException(ex)
      .setBody("Consumer error")
      .emit();
    // ..
  }
}
```

See [corresponding Java (tracing) instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/instrumentation/spring/spring-kafka-2.7/library/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/instrumentation/spring/kafka/v2_7/InstrumentedRecordInterceptor.java) for the details.

## Trade-offs and mitigations

1. Switching from recording exceptions as span events to log records is a breaking change
   for any component following existing [exception guidance](/specification/trace/exceptions.md).

   **Mitigation:**
   - OpenTelemetry API and/or SDK in the future may provide opt-in span events -> log-based events conversion,
     but that's not enough - instrumentations will have to change their behavior to report errors
     as logs with appropriate severity.
   - We should provide opt-in mechanism for existing instrumentations to switch to logs.

2. Recording exceptions as log-based events would result in UX degradation for users
   leveraging trace-only backends such as Jaeger.

   **Mitigation:**
   - OpenTelemetry API and/or SDK may provide span events -> log events conversion.
     See also [Event vision OTEP](./0265-event-vision.md#relationship-to-span-events).

## Prior art and alternatives

Alternatives:

1. Deduplicate exception info by marking exception instances as logged.
   This can potentially mitigate the problem for existing application when it logs exceptions extensively.
   We should still provide optimal guidance for the greenfield applications and libraries,
   covering wider problem of recording errors.

## Open questions

- Do we need to have log-related limits similar to [span event limits](/specification/trace/sdk.md#span-limits)
  on the SDK level?

## Future possibilities

Exception stack traces can be recorded in structured form instead of their
string representation. It may be easier to process and consume them in this form.
This is out of scope of this OTEP.
