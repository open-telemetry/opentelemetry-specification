**TL;DR**: We propose the next evolution of the [Telemetry Schema (OTEP-0152)][otep-0152] that enables an **efficient** consumption of the Telemetry schema pieces for the emerging collection and backend use cases. As a case study, we demonstrate how those changes will effectively enable:
* Ingestion layers to handle schema changes on the fly e.g.:
  * *OpenTelemetry Collector Schema Processor* with "versioned write" capability.
* Backends to [ultimately handle schema changes][prom-proposal] on the query layer, e.g.: 
  * *Prometheus* with [a PromQL "versioned read" capability][prom-prototype].
  * *???* logging/tracing backend with "version read" capability to prove this OTEP? Help wanted!
* "Traditionally schemaless" ecosystems to adopt telemetry "schematization" with all its benefits, e.g.:
   * *[Prometheus metrics](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/16428)* which historically were schemaless.

Before reading, we recommend familiarizing with [the attached glossary](#glossary) used in this document.

## Motivation

Long story short, it's challenging for the end-users to effectively **organize their observability data**, because the telemetry ecosystem is increasingly vast and rich.
 
To start solving this, OpenTelemetry community [established the telemetry semantic convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) to unify the telemetry pieces into "one representation". Accompanied [Telemetry Schema (OTEP-152) was specified to start the discussion on sustainability of that schema definitions (e.g. changes over time)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0152-telemetry-schemas.md#motivation). Specifically OTEP-152 defines [a public YAML Schema File with all the telemetry transformations between 1.0 and current version](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/schemas/1.32.0). To connect telemetry on the wire (or in storage) to their schema a [Schema URL](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0152-telemetry-schemas.md#schema-url) "link" was defined, pointing to that [schema file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/schemas/1.32.0). Finally, the [Weaver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver) project was established to consolidate with various schema operations (e.g.: validation, generation of schema file, code, documentation).

While it has been proven to be a great start, the Telemetry Schema [has known limitations](#current-limitations), surfaced by the lack of the adopted, backend and tools that would consume and utilize the Telemetry Schema File and Schema URL. As a result, it's still hard for end-users to adopt and maintain OpenTelemetry schemas and enjoy many **incredible** benefits like generative instrumentation and documentation, consistency and stability of telemetry consumption, signal correlations and more.

This OTEP proposes the next evolution of Telemetry Schema, beyond a single YAML file, based on [the PromQL/Prometheus Schema Changes](#prometheus-case-study) prototype using OpenTelemetry Schema (showcased in the [KubeCon Talk][kubecon-talk], and other experiments.

### Current Limitations

Let's enumerate a few high level limitations we could improve to enable efficient schema artifacts consumption:

* The Schema File referenced by the Schema URL:
  * **No link to the Schema Definitions**. Schema File is only focused on transformations. It's not specified how to get from the Schema URL to the Schema Definition (OTEP-0152 [out-of-scope](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0152-telemetry-schemas.md#what-is-out-of-scope)). This limits the ability for the ecosystem to experiment, innovate and extend schema tooling capabilities. We will always hit some limits of the generated artifacts we establish. Surfacing the raw definitions (source of truth) will mitigate this.
  * **Current transformation format is limited** (OTEP-0152 [out-of-scope](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0152-telemetry-schemas.md#what-is-out-of-scope)). On the example of the metric signal, it has been proven that more than the metric name can be auto-transformed without loosing any semantic information e.g. changes like metric unit, value, attribute tags or even enum values (see [demo][prom-prototype]).
  * **Scalability limits**. There's a strong need to split this file into smaller artifacts to support large number of versions, changes, signals and attributes.
  * **Future compatibility**. There's no notion of the "latest" schema version, required for consumption layers to translate certain telemetry schema version to future variants.
* The Schema Definition:
  * **No official, versioned specification** for the schema definitions (schema definition seems to be internally described by the [weaver spec][weaver-schema-def]). The source of every schema transformation or any other artifact starts with the schema definition. Ideally we have that YAML format and semantics well-defined and versioned--if we want wider ecosystem to define their telemetry in similar fashion.
  * **No reliable "semantic identification"**. It's not trivial to represent and auto-generate rich, reliable and efficient transformations out of the schema definitions, without "semantic connection". The current schema syntax offers the [`deprecated` field with the `rename_to` field](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver/blob/main/schemas/semconv-syntax.md#:~:text=deprecated%20%3A%3A%3D%20renamed%20renamed_to%20%5Bnote%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7C%20%20%20obsoleted%20%5Bnote%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7C%20%20%20uncategorized%20%5Bnote%5D) which not only limits what transformations one could do (as mentioned above), but also connect elements by "name" which:
    * Creates too soft link between "semantically identical" telemetry definitions, causing consumption in-efficiencies. For example, connecting telemetry pieces name and schema URL with a certain definition and all backwards and forward "variants".
    * Prevents transformations that change e.g. metric attribute without changing metric name.
  
## Goals

In general, the goal is to **enable practical and efficient consumption of the key Telemetry Schema Artifacts**.

Consumption use cases in the current scope:

* **Link to Schema Definitions**: Ability to access the current _definitions_ instead of only transformations (e.g. for extensibility, rich generative tooling, GenAI tools, etc.)
* **Version Write**: Ability to version the telemetry access on write APIs (e.g. for schema "ABC" auto-translate all the related attributes to a known version 1.2.0).
* **Versioned Read**: Ability to version the telemetry access on read APIs (e.g. pin selected metric to a "ABC" schema and 1.2.0 version on PromQL, so backend can fetch previous and new versions and show as 1.2.0 version).
* (lower priority) **Aliasing**: Ability to have two "current" telemetry schema definitions of the same semantic information to support alternative naming conventions or preferences.

Practical and efficient quality means:

* It's practical to _connect_ the telemetry in the storage/OTLP with the related definition, version and schema artifacts (e.g. transformations).
* It's practical to _connect_ the changed telemetry definitions (across versions) to a single "semantic" information.
* It's practical to _find and apply_ the related transformations for each telemetry definition and version.
* Basic transformations are supported e.g. changes like metric name, unit, value, attribute tags, enum values.
* It's practical to ensure further schema evolution (e.g. new transformations) does not break certain backend capabilities?

## Out of Scope

* Handle transformations that can't be trivially auto-translated or complex transformations that join or split attributes (in theory possible in future). 
* Defining anything that does not have a practical implementation/consumption in the OSS.

## Proposal

> @bwplotka: This is a starting point. Feedback/contributions/changes/researches/prototypes welcome! There are many ways of solving this!_

Generally, we propose the following high level changes:

1. Schema Definition: Create [an official specification for the Schema Definition files](#official-schema-definition-specification).
2. Schema Definition Semantic ID: Establish [strict format for making schema changes while preserving the same "semantic" information](#schema-definition-id-format). Notably, the Schema Definition's attribute/group `id` field format that enables **semantic identification** of the elements and new `deprecated` syntax.
3. Schema URL: Establish way [for Schema URL to link to multiple schema artifacts and resources](#schema-url-allow-reaching-multiple-schema-artifacts-definitions-latest-other-pieces) (not only Schema File) e.g. the specific version (or latest) raw schema definitions, various transformations, well-known paths etc. 
4. Schema Changes: Establish [the efficient transformation format](#efficient-schema-changestransformation-format) (potentially more than one, potentially per backend).
5. Schema Changes: (Best effort) Establish new Schema ID URL format for the efficient lookup from telemetry representation to telemetry definition ID.
6. Schema Web Security: We need mechanisms for ensuring schema URL resources integrity and security (e.g. checksums, auth, caching, proxying practices).

Further sections explain all changes in details (TBD: Help wanted!):

### Official Schema Definition Specification

The schema artifacts, including the [OTEP-0152's Schema File][otep-0152] is generated from the Schema Definitions [defined in Weaver][weaver-schema-def]. This definition format is already
used by [the OpenTelemetry Semantic Convention registry (model)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/f745220f91de4adbe868bebb33a17c615216ea15/model) with hundreds of carefully designed metrics, trace spans and logging attribute definitions.

Assuming, the vision is to allow OSS ecosystems and organizations to schematize their telemetry in the language compatible with OpenTelemetry, we have to focus on standardizing the schema definition structure.

> @bwplotka: In other words, what's more painful? Making a hidden breaking change to Schema File or Schema Definitions? I'd argue it's easier to handle breaking changes in the former given it can be auto-generated from Schema Definitions.

To enable wider adoptions, we propose releasing an official, versioned **Telemetry Schema Definition 1.0** specification based on [that schema definition format][weaver-schema-def]. We can revise it slightly (in backward compatible manner), add versioning (e.g. `version: <number>` field) and explain its semantics around the handling and validation in the [RFC-2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) format.

With this specification, we can focus on the data model, instead of forcing YAML specifically -- we could easily support the same data model also in JSON, protobuf etc.

**Telemetry Schema Definition 1.0** specification would allow easier discovery, education and stability that's required to encourage other ecosystem to do the extra work of defining their telemetry (or using already defined one in OpenTelemetry SemConv!). For example, not many will schematize traditionally schemaless Prometheus metrics without an official spec. For Prometheus users who wish to migrate to OpenTelemetry defined metrics, having the **current** Prometheus metrics defined is a key, so the automated transformation we discuss in this OTEP is possible for them to enable any practical migrations.

In the future, we could discuss tailored definition language that might transparently compile to the `Telemetry Schema Definition 1.0` data model.

### Schema Definition ID Format

The `id` (group and attribute) field in schema definition is loosely defined. In Weaver sometimes it has to be globally unique, sometimes not (e.g. when nested for metric attribute). It seemed this field was historically only used practically by humans, not automation.

We propose to establish a strict definition of the `id` format as follows:

* Top level group `id` field MUST use a short, globally unique set of characters matching `^(?P<semantic_id>[a-z_]+)(|.(?P<revision>\d+))$` regex.
* Nested `id` field MUST use a short, locally unique set of characters matching `^(?P<nested_id>[a-z_]+)$` regex.

Following that, we propose to extend the `deprecated` section (for the top level group) to have `reason: updated` reason and contain `replace_by_id` field that specified full ID of the element it semantically replaces.

For example:

```yaml
groups:
- id: "my_app_latency.2"
  type: metric
  metric_name: my.app.latency # Previously "my.app.old_latency".
  unit: "{second}" # Previously "{millisecond}". ("s"?)
  instrument: "histogram"
  brief: "Histogram with my-app latency seconds"
  attributes:
  - id: code
    tag: code
    type: int
    brief: "HTTP status code." 
# ...
### Deprecated elements.
- id: "my_app_latency"
  type: metric
  metric_name: my.app.old_latency
  unit: "{millisecond}"
  instrument: "histogram"
  brief: "Histogram with my-app latency milliseconds"
  deprecated:
    reason: updated
    note: "Ups, we did not use base unit, our bad. This metric should be auto-transformable, see diff for all changes."
    # Points to the replacement.
    replaced_by_id: "my_app_latency.2"
    # Unit requires transformation, this could be implicitly defined for the trivial unit conversions.
    forward_promql: "value{} / 1000"
    backward_promql: "value{} * 1000"
  attributes:
  - id: code
    type: int
    brief: "HTTP status code."
```

See [the full example demo Schema Definition file](https://github.com/bwplotka/metric-rename-demo/blob/067ff33896a0eca544332d9c40485d61162ae572/my-org/semconv/registry/my-app.yaml) that follows this proposal.

This format and deprecation allows:

* Reliable connection for elements that share exactly the same semantic ID.
* Reliable way for consumers to go from the element unique ID to its semantic ID.
* Deprecation schema as it is now, where the "semantically convertible" changed element is a new element in the definition, instead of the change in place (see [the alternative that challenges the current deprecation process](#schema-definition-in-place-changes)). 

As a result, we are able to reduce the amount of data required to [represent useful transformations per semantic ID](#efficient-schema-changestransformation-format). The "revision" number, becomes then a location in the forward/backward chain (See [The efficient schema change format](#efficient-schema-changestransformation-format)).

### Schema URL allow reaching multiple Schema artifacts (definitions, latest, other pieces)

The main goal is to enable consumers to reliable and efficiently access various schema artifacts like definitions, documentation, transformation formats or anything else we will add in the future.

We propose to follow the pattern, proven by [the Prometheus prototype][prom-prototype], where the schema resources are fetched using Schema URL pieces.
 
Notably, given the `http[s]://server[:port]/path/<version>` Schema URL format, we propose to define the **Base Schema URL** (`<schema_base_url>`) that essentially represents the main server/location URL for the Schema resources. Base Schema URL is essentially Schema URL without the version suffix, so `http[s]://server[:port]/path/`.

From here we have two high level choices -- we can either establish and define an OpenTelemetry Schema API or "generic file based URLs", so define set of known plain file-like resource location URLs.

> @bwplotka: To be discussed, what's preferred by this community. The generic file based URL is less extensible (e.g. dynamic parameters), robust and secure, but serving those pieces is dead simple.

#### Schema API

In this idea, we propose to establish a stable, well-defined REST HTTP API for Schema resources. The `<schema_base_url>` would point to that server.

The HTTP responses would need to be defined (TBD), likely in JSON.

The Schema HTTP API could define following paths:
 
* GET `<schema_base_url>/<version (starting by number)>` returns Schema File for the compatibility purposes.
* GET `<schema_base_url>/v1/latest` for the latest schema version.
* GET `<schema_base_url>/v1/.well-known` for [the API/resources sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI).
* GET `<schema_base_url>/v1/changes?filter=<signal or semantic ID>&format=<transformation format>` for the transformation and elements of the choice.
* GET `<schema_base_url>/v1/definitions?filter=<...>&version=<version or latest>` for the Schema definitions.

Pros:
* Clean, reliable and secure for consumers.
* Standard security practices apply.
* Flexibility
  * Clear path for iterating and adding more resources over time (e.g. new paths, new parameters).
  * Supports dynamic parameters e.g. custom filtering.
* This being a simple HTTP REST API makes it trivial to implement by anyone.

Cons:
 * It requires a bit more work on producer/definer side (you have to host a custom HTTP server).

#### Alternative: Keep it simple and file-based

The alternative is to keep the Schema URL as-is right now, so to point to plain text-based resources with some path parameters: e.g.

 * `<schema_base_url>/<version>` returns Schema File for the compatibility.
 * `<schema_base_url>h/latest` for the latest schema version.
 * `<schema_base_url>/v1/.well-known` for [the API/resources sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI).
 * `<schema_base_url>/v1/changes/<signal>/<transformation format>` for the transformation and elements of the choice.
 * `<schema_base_url>/v1/definitions/<version>` for the Schema definitions.
 * etc..

Pros:
* Can be trivially hosted locally or remotely e.g. using GitHub.

Cons:
* We need to innovate on security practices (checksums, proxying, etc.)
* Hard to evolve.
* Hard to implement dynamic parameters (e.g. filtering)

### Efficient Schema Changes/Transformation Format

> @bwplotka: To be discussed but my idea was to be able to publish multiple transformation languages, as I believe there is no single one that will
> work best for all use cases. For example for Prometheus PromQL layer, one pragmatic and efficient format would be something like this, grouped
> by the [semantic ID](#schema-definition-id-format):

```yaml
# Version of this file.
version: 1

# changelog contains all changes made to elements with the same semantic id
# sorted from the newest to the oldest.
metrics_changelog:
  my_app_latency:
  # my_app_latency vs my_app_latency.2
  - forward:
      metric_name: my_app_latency_seconds
      unit: "{second}"
      value_promql: "value{} / 1000"
    backward:
      metric_name: my_app_latency_milliseconds
      unit: "{millisecond}"
      value_promql: "value{} * 1000"

  my_app_custom_elements:
  # my_app_custom_elements.2 vs my_app_custom_elements.3
  - forward:
      attributes:
      - tag: "my_number"
    backward:
      attributes:
      - tag: "number"
    # my_app_custom_elements vs my_app_custom_elements.2
  - forward:
      metric_name: my_app_custom_changed_elements_total
      attributes:
      - tag: "number"
      - tag: "class"
        members:
        - value: "FIRST"
        - value: "SECOND"
        - value: "OTHER"
    backward:
      metric_name: my_app_custom_elements_total
      attributes:
      - tag: "integer"
      - tag: "category"
        members:
        - value: "first"
        - value: "second"
        - value: "other" 
```

> @bwplotka: This file could be auto-generated on demand by Prometheus or hosted in the Schema registry and referenced by e.g. Schema URL/API like `http[s]://server[:port]/path/changes?filter=type:metric&format=promql`
> Other formats e.g. the current OTEP-0152 one and OTTL could be a good idea to publish as well, given their own benefits.

### Schema File

The [OTEP-0152 specified Schema File](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0152-telemetry-schemas.md#schema-file, which describes the schema changes per version (aka "transformations").

To achieve goals of this OTEP, we are proposing [new transformations](#efficient-schema-changestransformation-format) and new ways [to utilize Schema URL to access those new resources](#schema-url-allow-reaching-multiple-schema-artifacts-definitions-latest-other-pieces). This means that consumers will have a choice to get the related transformations and artifacts outside the original Schema File e.g. via `<schema_base_url>/v1/changes?filter=<signal or semantic ID>&format=<transformation format>` API or `<schema_base_url>/v1/changes/all/<transformation format>` URL.

However, the current or future iterations of this single & big file with all the telemetry version's transformations could be still supported. We could allow accessing it via `<schema_base_url>/v1/changes?format=schema_file@1.1.0` or `<schema_url>` for the compatibility.

> @bwplotka: How many/what type of (programmatic) users the current Schema File has? We likely should do a survey/research about current Schema File use to learn more about major use cases; not yet covered in this OTEP.

### Schema ID URL Optimization

> @bwplotka: To be explained, but if we follow the [Semantic ID](#schema-definition-id-format) idea, we could establish something like Schema ID URL and attach that to our telemetry (instead or on top of the Schema URL).
> For example with the format like `http[s]://server[:port]/path#<semantic-ID`. The motivation is efficiency. For the consumers knowing the semantic ID offers reach capabilities to index the telemetry by schema and semantic ID. This information is the also incredible useful to
> [fast lookup the related transformations](#efficient-schema-changestransformation-format).
> 
> Without Schema ID URL, consumption layers would need to build mappings from telemetry names to ID/semantic ID as we did in Prometheus prototype ([ids.yaml](https://github.com/bwplotka/metric-rename-demo/blob/main/my-org/semconv/ids.yaml)).
> With SchemaID the PromQL "versioned-read" could look as follows:

```
 # PromQL query with special schema_url selector; pinning query to a certain schema registry and a certain metric ID (semantic-id.2):
old_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.2"}

# Series in storage:
older_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.1", instance="A"} 1
old_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.2", instance="B"} 2
new_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.3", instance="C"} 3

# Series returned:
old_metric_name{instance="A"} 1
old_metric_name{instance="B"} 2
old_metric_name{instance="C"} 3
```

### Security Considerations

All Schema pieces are designed to be stored and access from the remote sources.
 
> @bwplotka: TBD security considerations for this.

### Aliasing

https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0152-telemetry-schemas.md#name-aliases

## Prometheus Case Study

For the full context, see [the KubeCon EU talk][kubecon-talk] that motivates why Prometheus
ecosystem needs schema and PromQL "versioned read" to automatically handle schema changes.
See [the prototype technical details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14y4wdZdRMC676qPLDqBQZfaCA6Dog_3ukzmjLOgAL-k/edit?tab=t.f0p1e46oa2c).

Generally [Prometheus users are looking for ways to automate schema changes and schema migrations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14y4wdZdRMC676qPLDqBQZfaCA6Dog_3ukzmjLOgAL-k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1hb3zptlu59q). To achieve a [prototype][prom-prototype] and [proposal][prom-proposal] were created to:
* Allow and encourage subset of Prometheus metrics to be defined in OpenTelemetry schema (with Prometheus or OpenTelemetry naming).
* Implement PromQL versioned read that allows "pinning" queried metrics to a certain schema and version (generally to a certain metric ID):

Notably, PromQL syntax in prototype could work as follows:

``` 
# PromQL query with special schema_url selector; pinning query to a certain schema registry and a version,
old_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv/1.1.0"}

# Series in storage:
older_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv/1.0.0", instance="A"} 1
old_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv/1.1.0", instance="B"} 2
new_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv/1.2.0", instance="C"} 3

# Series returned:
old_metric_name{instance="A"} 1
old_metric_name{instance="B"} 2
old_metric_name{instance="C"} 3
```

However, more efficient evolution is proposed, that ties schema URL to true "element" ID with a certain format:

```
# PromQL query with special schema_url selector; pinning query to a certain schema registry and a certain metric ID (semantic-id.2):
old_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.2"}

# Series in storage:
older_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.1", instance="A"} 1
old_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.2", instance="B"} 2
new_metric_name{__schema_url__="https://example.com/semconv#semantic-id.3", instance="C"} 3

# Series returned:
old_metric_name{instance="A"} 1
old_metric_name{instance="B"} 2
old_metric_name{instance="C"} 3
```

## Trade-offs and mitigations

* TBD

## Alternatives

### Alternative Schema Definition Formats

> TBD: Explore alternative data models?

### Alternative Transformation Formats/Languages

> TBD: Explore alternative formats, why not purely OTTL, any query language or anything else!

### Schema Definition in-place Changes

> TBD:

## Future Possibilities

### Advanced transformations

> TBD: Explain and discuss what could be added in future -- e.g. splitting or merging attributes could be possible.

## Open questions

1. What about "almost" semantically identical schema changes? For example, there might be a telemetry piece that was capturing latency of Go garbage collection doing X and Y. In the next Go version, runtime loose ability to track Y but enables Z, so producers have to switch to a telemetry piece that measures X and Z. In practice, the majority of users would NOT notice a difference, but technically this should be another telemetry piece and out of scope of this OTEP. Should we enable some process that allows "close enough semantic changes"?
2. Is it possible for Telemetry Schema spec to define a single transformation format that would work for **every** backend and translation logic? E.g. in Prometheus and PromQL you could handle some type changes (!) or advanced attribute changes like label splits/merges, but what if that's not possible for e.g. vendor? What if it's not possible for a certain version of backend? Should transformation formats be owned and maintained by each backend instead?
3. Feedback from the KubeCon talk audience: Does Schema URL version need to use semantic versioning? One perspective is that all changes are either breaking or non-breaking (e.g. description?).

## Glossary

* **Schema**: Generally it means the shape of your telemetry "attributes", e.g.: tracing span names, logging fields, metric name, type, unit, metric labels etc.
* **Schema Definition**: Place where you describe the shape of your telemetry, the source of truth.
* **Schema File**: As per OTEP-0152, the versioned, single file with schema changes transformations.
* **Schema URL**: As per OTEP-0152, the URL where the Schema File can be found, ideally provided by the telemetry pieces to reference their schema.
* **Schema Pieces/Artifacts**: Generally, all the resources related to telemetry schemas e.g. definitions, generated code, documentation, transformations etc.
* **Telemetry Attribute Identity**: Piece of information that allows to identify a unique telemetry attribute (e.g. metric, span or metric tag).
* **Telemetry Attribute Semantic Identity**: Piece of information that allows to identify a group of the telemetry attributes that represent the same semantic information (e.g. span that traces the stop-the-word event in the Go garbage collection).
