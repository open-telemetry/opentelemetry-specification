groups:
  - id: browser
    prefix: browser
    type: resource
    brief: >
        The web browser in which the application represented by the resource is running.
        The `browser.*` attributes MUST be used only for resources that represent applications
        running in a web browser (regardless of whether running on a mobile or desktop device).
    attributes:
      - id: brands
        type: string[]
        brief: 'Array of brand name and version separated by a space'
        note: >
          This value is intended to be taken from the
          [UA client hints API](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#interface)
          (`navigator.userAgentData.brands`).
        examples: [" Not A;Brand 99", "Chromium 99", "Chrome 99"]
      - id: platform
        type: string
        brief: 'The platform on which the browser is running'
        note: >
          This value is intended to be taken from the
          [UA client hints API](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#interface)
          (`navigator.userAgentData.platform`). If unavailable, the legacy
          `navigator.platform` API SHOULD NOT be used instead and this attribute
          SHOULD be left unset in order for the values to be consistent.

          The list of possible values is defined in the
          [W3C User-Agent Client Hints specification](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#sec-ch-ua-platform).
          Note that some (but not all) of these values can overlap with values
          in the [`os.type` and `os.name` attributes](./os.md).
          However, for consistency, the values in the `browser.platform` attribute
          should capture the exact value that the user agent provides.
        examples: ['Windows', 'macOS', 'Android']
      - id: mobile
        type: boolean
        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the browser is running on a mobile device'
        note: >
          This value is intended to be taken from the
          [UA client hints API](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#interface)
          (`navigator.userAgentData.mobile`). If unavailable, this attribute
          SHOULD be left unset.
      - id: language
        type: string
        brief: 'Preferred language of the user using the browser'
        note: >
          This value is intended to be taken from the Navigator API
          `navigator.language`.
        examples: ["en", "en-US", "fr", "fr-FR"]
      - ref: user_agent.original
        brief: 'Full user-agent string provided by the browser'
        note: >
          The user-agent value SHOULD be provided only from browsers that do not have a mechanism
          to retrieve brands and platform individually from the User-Agent Client Hints API.
          To retrieve the value, the legacy `navigator.userAgent` API can be used.
        examples: ['Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.54 Safari/537.36']
      - id: visitor_id
        type: string
        brief: An anonymous id for the visiting user.
        note: >
          This will remain same in a given browser session, and will persist
          across page navigations in the same browser session.
        examples: ["123"]
      - id: session_id
        type: string
        brief: Identifier for the current browser session
        examples: ["123"]
      - id: page_impression_id
        type: string
        brief: Unique id for the page impression, represented by a GUID
        note: >
          As an example, Page.html will yield 4 impression ids if the page is
          refreshed 4 times in the same browser instance. For SPA apps, every
          URL change results in a new impression.
        examples: ["12627cc493-f310-47de-96bd-71410b7dec043"]
      - id: screen_width
        type: int
        brief: Screen width of the device/browser view port
        examples: [600]
      - id: screen_height
        type: int
        brief: Screen height of the device/browser view port
        examples: [400]
      - id: url
        type: string
        brief: Complete URL of the current active page including the URL fragment
        examples: ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#foo"]
