    brief: >
      A serverless instance.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        required: always
        brief: >
          The name of the function being executed.
        examples: ['my-function']
      - id: id
        type: string
        required: always
        brief: >
          The unique ID of the function
          being executed.
        note: >
          For example, in AWS Lambda this field corresponds to the
          [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
          value, in GCP to the URI of the resource, and in Azure to the
          [FunctionDirectory](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Retrieving-information-about-the-currently-running-function)
          field.
        examples: ['arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function']
      - id: version
        type: string
        brief: >
          The version string of the function being executed as defined in
          [Version Attributes](../../resource/semantic_conventions/README.md#version-attributes).
        examples: ['2.0.0']
      - id: instance
        type: string
        brief: >
          The execution environment ID as a string.
        examples: ['my-function:instance-0001']
      - id: max_memory
        type: int
        brief: >
          The amount of memory available to the serverless function in MiB.
        note: >
          It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily
          stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly.
          On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`
          provides this information.
        examples: 128
