    brief: >
      A serverless instance.
    attributes:

        brief: >
          The name of the single function that this runtime instance executes.
        note:
          This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
          platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
          function (which may be stored in the
          [`code.namespace`/`code.function`](../../trace/semantic_conventions/span-general.md#source-code-attributes)
          span attributes).
        examples: ['my-function']
      - id: id
        type: string
        brief: >
          The unique ID of the single function that this runtime instance executes.
        note: |
          Depending on the cloud provider, use:

          * **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
          Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
          [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html) with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invokable with multiple
          different aliases.
          * **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
          * **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id).

          On some providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
          which is why this field cannot be made required. For example, on AWS the account ID
          part of the ARN is not available without calling another AWS API
          which may be deemed too slow for a short-running lambda function.
          As an alternative, consider setting `faas.id` as a span attribute instead.
        examples: ['arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function']
      - id: version
        type: string
        brief: The immutable version of the function being executed.
        note: |
          Depending on the cloud provider and platform, use:

          * **AWS Lambda:** The [function version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html)
            (an integer represented as a decimal string).
          * **Google Cloud Run:** The [revision](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/revisions)
            (i.e., the function name plus the revision suffix).
          * **Google Cloud Functions:** The value of the
            [`K_REVISION` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var#runtime_environment_variables_set_automatically).
          * **Azure Functions:** Not applicable. Do not set this attribute.
        examples: ['26', 'pinkfroid-00002']
      - id: instance
        type: string
        brief: >
          The execution environment ID as a string, that will be potentially reused
          for other invocations to the same function/function version.
        note: >
          * **AWS Lambda:** Use the (full) log stream name.
        examples: ['2021/06/28/[$LATEST]2f399eb14537447da05ab2a2e39309de']
      - id: max_memory
        type: int
        brief: >
          The amount of memory available to the serverless function in MiB.
        note: >
          It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily
          stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly.
          On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`
          provides this information.
        examples: 128
