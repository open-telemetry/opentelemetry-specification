    brief: >
      A serverless instance.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        requirement_level: required
        brief: >
          The name of the single function that this runtime instance executes.
        note: |
          This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
          platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
          function (which may be stored in the
          [`code.namespace`/`code.function`](../../trace/semantic_conventions/span-general.md#source-code-attributes)
          span attributes).

          For some cloud providers, the above definition is ambiguous. The following
          definition of function name MUST be used for this attribute
          (and consequently the span name) for the listed cloud providers/products:

          * **Azure:**  The full name `<FUNCAPP>/<FUNC>`, i.e., function app name
            followed by a forward slash followed by the function name (this form
            can also be seen in the resource JSON for the function).
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function
            app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider (see also the `cloud.resource_id` attribute).
        examples: ['my-function', 'myazurefunctionapp/some-function-name']
      - id: version
        type: string
        brief: The immutable version of the function being executed.
        note: |
          Depending on the cloud provider and platform, use:

          * **AWS Lambda:** The [function version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html)
            (an integer represented as a decimal string).
          * **Google Cloud Run:** The [revision](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/revisions)
            (i.e., the function name plus the revision suffix).
          * **Google Cloud Functions:** The value of the
            [`K_REVISION` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var#runtime_environment_variables_set_automatically).
          * **Azure Functions:** Not applicable. Do not set this attribute.
        examples: ['26', 'pinkfroid-00002']
      - id: instance
        type: string
        brief: >
          The execution environment ID as a string, that will be potentially reused
          for other invocations to the same function/function version.
        note: >
          * **AWS Lambda:** Use the (full) log stream name.
        examples: ['2021/06/28/[$LATEST]2f399eb14537447da05ab2a2e39309de']
      - id: max_memory
        type: int
        brief: >
          The amount of memory available to the serverless function converted to Bytes.
        note: >
          It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily
          stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly.
          On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`
          provides this information (which must be multiplied by 1,048,576).
        examples: 134217728
