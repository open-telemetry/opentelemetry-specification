          The name of the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set
          to the `Name` in `proc/[pid]/status`. On Windows, can be set to the
          base name of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`.

        brief: >
          The full path to the process executable. On Linux based systems, can
          be set to the target of `proc/[pid]/exe`. On Windows, can be set to the
          result of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`.

        brief: >
          The command used to launch the process (i.e. the command name). On Linux
          based systems, can be set to the zeroth string in `proc/[pid]/cmdline`.
          On Windows, can be set to the first parameter extracted from `GetCommandLineW`.

        brief: >
          The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing
          the full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetCommandLineW`.
          Do not set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use
          `process.command_args` instead.

        brief: >
          All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) as
          received by the process. On Linux-based systems (and some other Unixoid
          systems supporting procfs), can be set according to the list of
          null-delimited strings extracted from `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. For libc-based
          executables, this would be the full argv vector passed to `main`.
        examples: ['cmd/otecol', '--config=config.yaml']
