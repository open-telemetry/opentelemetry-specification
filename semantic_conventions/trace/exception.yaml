groups:
  - id: exception
    prefix: exception
    brief: >
      This document defines the attributes used to
      report a single exception associated with a span.
    attributes:
      - id: type
        type: string
        brief: >
          The type of the exception (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable).
          The dynamic type of the exception should be preferred over the static type
          in languages that support it.
        examples: ["java.net.ConnectException","OSError"]
      - id: message
        type: string
        brief: The exception message.
        examples: ["Division by zero","Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"]
      - id: stacktrace
        type: string
        brief: >
          A stacktrace as a string in the natural representation for the language runtime.
          The representation is to be determined and documented by each language SIG.
        examples: 'Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Test exception\n
        at com.example.GenerateTrace.methodB(GenerateTrace.java:13)\n
        at com.example.GenerateTrace.methodA(GenerateTrace.java:9)\n
        at com.example.GenerateTrace.main(GenerateTrace.java:5)'
      - id: escaped
        type: boolean
        brief: >
          SHOULD be set to true if the exception event is recorded at a point where
          it is known that the exception is escaping the scope of the span (e.g. if
          there is an exception active just before ending the span).
        note: >
          Note that an exception may still leave the scope of the span even if this
          was not set or set to false, if the event was recorded at an earlier time.
