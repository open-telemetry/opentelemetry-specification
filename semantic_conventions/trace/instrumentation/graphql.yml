    attributes:
      - id: operation.name
        brief: "The name of the operation being executed."
        type: string
        examples: 'findBookById'
      - id: operation.type
        brief: "The type of the operation being executed."
        type:
          allow_custom_values: false
          members:
            - id: query
              value: "query"

            - id: mutation
              value: "mutation"
              brief: "GraphQL mutation"
            - id: subscription
              value: "subscription"
