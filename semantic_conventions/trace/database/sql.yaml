      - id: table

        required:
          conditional: Recommended if available.
        brief: The name of the primary table that the operation is acting upon, including the database name (if applicable).
        note: >
          It is not recommended to attempt any client-side parsing of
          `db.statement` just to get this property, but it should be set if
          it is provided by the library being instrumented.
          If the operation is acting upon an anonymous table, or more than one table, this
          value MUST NOT be set.
