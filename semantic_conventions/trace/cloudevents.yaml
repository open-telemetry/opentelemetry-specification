        This document defines attributes for CloudEvents.
        CloudEvents is a specification on how to define event data in a standard way.
        These attributes can be attached to spans when performing operations with CloudEvents, regardless of the protocol being used.
    attributes:
      - id: event_id
        type: string
        brief: >
          The [event_id](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md#id) uniquely identifies the event.
        note: >
          Producers MUST ensure that event_source + event_id is unique for each distinct event.
          If a duplicate event is re-sent (e.g. due to a network error) it MAY have the same id.
          Consumers MAY assume that Events with identical event_source and event_id are duplicates.
        examples: ['123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', '0001']
      - id: event_source
        type: string
        brief: >
          The [source](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md#source-1) identifies the context in which an event happened.
        examples: ['https://github.com/cloudevents', '/cloudevents/spec/pull/123', 'my-service' ]
      - id: event_spec_version
        type: string
        brief: >
          The [version of the CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md#specversion) which the event uses.
        examples: '1.0'
      - id: event_type
        type: string
        brief: >
          The [event_type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md#type) contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence.
        examples: ['com.github.pull_request.opened', 'com.example.object.deleted.v2']
      - id: event_subject
        type: string
        brief: >
          The [subject](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md#subject) of the event in the context of the event producer (identified by source).
        examples: 'mynewfile.jpg'
