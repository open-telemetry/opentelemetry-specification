        This semantic convention describes an instance of a function that
        runs without provisioning or managing of servers (also known as
        serverless functions or Function as a Service (FaaS)) with spans.

            On FaaS instances, faas.trigger MUST be set on incoming invocations.
            Clients invoking FaaS instances MUST set `faas.trigger` on outgoing
            invocations, if it is known to the client. This is, for example, not
            the case, when the transport layer is abstracted in a FaaS client
            framework without access to its configuration.

            For some cloud providers, like AWS or GCP, the region in which a
            function is hosted is essential to uniquely identify the function
            and also part of its endpoint. Since it's part of the endpoint
            being called, the region is always known to clients. In these cases,
            `faas.invoked_region` MUST be set accordingly. If the region is
            unknown to the client or not required for identifying the invoked
            function, setting `faas.invoked_region` is optional.
