            Message keys in Kafka are used for grouping alike messages to ensure they're processed on the same partition.
            They differ from `messaging.message_id` in that they're not unique.
            If the key is `null`, the attribute MUST NOT be set.
          note: >
            If the key type is not string, it's string representation has to be supplied for the attribute.
            If the key has no unambiguous, canonical string form, don't include its value.
