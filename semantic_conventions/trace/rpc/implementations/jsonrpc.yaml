          `id` property of request or response.
          Since protocol allows id to be int, string, `null` or missing (for notifications),
          value is expected to be cast to string for simplicity.
          Use empty string in case of `null` value. Omit entirely if this is a notification.
        examples: ['10', 'request-7', '']
      - id: error_code
        type: int
        required:
          conditional: 'If missing, response is assumed to be successful.'
        brief: "`error.code` property of response if it is an error response."

      - id: error_message
        type: string
        brief: "`error.message` property of response if it is an error response."

          This is always required for jsonrpc. See the note in the general
          RPC conventions for more information.
