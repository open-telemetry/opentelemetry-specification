    brief: >
      This semantic convention defines the attributes used to represent a
      feature flag evaluation as a span.
    span_kind: internal
    attributes:
      - id: flag_key
        type: string
        requirement_level: required
        brief: The unique identifier of the feature flag.
        examples: ["logo-color"]
      - id: provider_name
        type: string
        requirement_level: recommended
        brief: The name of the service that performs the flag evaluation.
        examples: ["Flag Manager"]
      - id: evaluated_variant
        type: string
        brief: The human readable name that identifies the evaluated value.
        examples: ["red", "blue", "green"]
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: >
            A variant should be used if it is available. If the variant is
            present, feature_flag.evaluated_value should be omitted.
      - id: evaluated_value
        type: string
        brief: A string representation of the evaluated value.
        examples: ["ff0000", "0000ff", "00ff00"]
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: >
            The value should only be used if the variant is not available. How
            the value is represented as a string should be determined by the
            implementer.
