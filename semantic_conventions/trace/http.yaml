        note: >
            `http.url` is usually not readily available on the server side but would have to be assembled in a cumbersome and
            sometimes lossy process from other information (see e.g. open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/148).
            It is thus preferred to supply the raw data that is available.

        note: |
            This is not necessarily the same as `net.sock.peer.addr`, which would
            identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.

            This attribute should be set when a source of information different
            from the one used for `net.sock.peer.addr`, is available even if that other
            source just confirms the same value as `net.sock.peer.addr`.
            Rationale: For `net.sock.peer.addr`, one typically does not know if it
            comes from a proxy, reverse proxy, or the actual client. Setting
            `http.client_ip` when it's the same as `net.sock.peer.addr` means that
            one is at least somewhat confident that the address is not that of
            the closest proxy.
