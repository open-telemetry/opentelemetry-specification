        These conventions can be used for http and https schemes
        and various HTTP versions like 1.1, 2 and SPDY.

      - id: url
        type: string
        brief: >
            Full HTTP request URL in the form `scheme://host[:port]/path?query[#fragment]`.
            Usually the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless.

        brief: >
            The value of the [HTTP host header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4).
            When the header is empty or not present, this attribute should be the same.
        examples: ['www.example.org']

        note: >
          If `net.transport` is not specified, it can be assumed to be `IP.TCP` except if `http.flavor`
          is `QUIC`, in which case `IP.UDP` is assumed.

          The size of the request payload body in bytes. This is the number of bytes transferred excluding headers and
          is often, but not always, present as the [Content-Length](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2)
          header. For requests using transport encoding, this should be the compressed size.
        examples: 3495
      - id: request_content_length_uncompressed
        type: number
        brief: >
          The size of the uncompressed request payload body after transport decoding. Not set if transport encoding not used.

            The primary server name of the matched virtual host. This should be obtained via configuration.
            If no such configuration can be obtained, this attribute MUST NOT be set ( `net.host.name` should be used instead).
        note: >
            `http.url` is usually not readily available on the server side but would have to be assembled in a cumbersome and
            sometimes lossy process from other information (see e.g. open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/148).
            It is thus preferred to supply the raw data that is available.

        note: >
            This is not necessarily the same as `net.peer.ip`, which would identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.
