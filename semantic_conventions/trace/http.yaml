            Usually the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless.

        note: >
          The resend count SHOULD be updated each time an HTTP request gets resent by the client, regardless of what
          was the cause of the resending (e.g. redirection, authorization failure, 503 Server Unavailable, network issues,
          or any other).
        requirement_level:

            The IP address of the original client behind all proxies, if
            known (e.g. from [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)).
        note: |
            This is not necessarily the same as `net.sock.peer.addr`, which would
            identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.

            This attribute should be set when a source of information different
            from the one used for `net.sock.peer.addr`, is available even if that other
            source just confirms the same value as `net.sock.peer.addr`.
            Rationale: For `net.sock.peer.addr`, one typically does not know if it
            comes from a proxy, reverse proxy, or the actual client. Setting
            `http.client_ip` when it's the same as `net.sock.peer.addr` means that
            one is at least somewhat confident that the address is not that of
            the closest proxy.
