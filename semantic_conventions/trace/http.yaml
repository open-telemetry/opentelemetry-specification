        These conventions can be used for http and https schemes

          The ordinal number of request resending attempt (for any reason, including redirects).
        note: >
          The resend count SHOULD be updated each time an HTTP request gets resent by the client, regardless of what
          was the cause of the resending (e.g. redirection, authorization failure, 503 Server Unavailable, network issues,
          or any other).

          If an HTTP client request is explicitly made to an IP address, e.g. `http://x.x.x.x:8080`, then
          `server.address` SHOULD be the IP address `x.x.x.x`. A DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used.
