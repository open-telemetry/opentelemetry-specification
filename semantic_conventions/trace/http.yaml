          The resend count SHOULD be updated each time an HTTP request gets resent by the client, regardless of what
          was the cause of the resending (e.g. redirection, authorization failure, 503 Server Unavailable, network issues,
          or any other).

        note: |
            `http.forwarded.for` is usually represented by the first [`for`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7239.html#section-5.2)
            parameter in the `Forwarded` header or the first IP address in the
            [`X-Forwarded-For`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header.
            This is not the same as `net.sock.peer.addr`, which would
            identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.
            This attribute SHOULD be set when a source of information different
            from the one used for `net.sock.peer.addr` is available and SHOULD NOT be set
            if there is no such source.
