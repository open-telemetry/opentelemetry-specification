          Instrumentation MAY additionally support a closet set of custom HTTP methods defined in [HTTP method registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml) or a private registry. 
          Instrumentation MUST set the `http.method` attribute to `OTHER` if the HTTP request method is not known to this instrumentation.
