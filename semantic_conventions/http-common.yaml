        note: |
          HTTP request method SHOULD be one of the methods defined in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
          or the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).
          Instrumentation MAY additionally support the closed set of custom HTTP methods defined in
          [HTTP method registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml) or a private registry.
          If the HTTP request method is not known to the instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `OTHER` and SHOULD 
          populate the exact method passed by client on `http.request.original_method` attribute.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.method` attribute value MUST match a standard (or documented elsewhere) HTTP method name exactly.
