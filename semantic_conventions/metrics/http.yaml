          - The [primary server name](/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#http-server-definitions) of the matched virtual host. MUST only
            include host identifier.
          - Host identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)

          - Host identifier of the `Host` header

          SHOULD NOT be set if only IP address is available and capturing name would require a reverse DNS lookup.
