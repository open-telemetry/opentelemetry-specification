          If a value is provided other log records, with the same value, will be considered to be duplicates and can be removed safely.
          This means, that two distinguishable log records MUST have different values.
          However in the case of duplication it is not guaranteed that duplicated log records have the same value.
        examples: ["click", "exception"]
