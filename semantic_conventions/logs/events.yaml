        This document defines attributes for Events represented using Log Records.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        requirement_level: required

        examples: ['click', 'exception']

        note: |
          An `event.name` is supposed to be unique only in the context of an
          `event.domain`, so this allows for two events in different domains to
          have same `event.name`, yet be unrelated events.
      - id: data
        brief: >
         The data attribute contains nested attributes which can be custom or set of defined attributes for schemas for specific scenarios.
         Eg: PageView, UserInteraction, etc from RUM events.
