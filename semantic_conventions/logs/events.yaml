        This document defines attributes for Events represented using Log Records.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        requirement_level: required
        brief: >
          The name identifies the event.
        examples: ['click', 'exception']
      - id: domain
        type: string
        brief: >
          The domain identifies the context in which an event happened. An event name is unique only within a domain.
        examples: ['browser', 'mobile', 'kubernetes']
        note: |
          An `event.name` is supposed to be unique only in the context of an
          `event.domain`, so this allows for two events in different domains to
          have same `event.name`, yet be unrelated events. No claim is made
          about the uniqueness of `event.name`s in the absence of `event.domain`.
