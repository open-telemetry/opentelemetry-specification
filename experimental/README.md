# Experimental features

This folder will be used to develop experimental features. Experimental features must be:

- Implementeable as a plugin to OpenTelemetry components (API, SDK, collector, etc.).
- Be in active development or testing.
- Approved as a general direction via OTEP process.

Experimental status allows to develop components that are on trajectory to become a part of a main package while developed on a faster cadence. Experimental status preceeds alpha version. Specifications from this folder MUST go thru the regular PR review process when moving out of experimental status.
